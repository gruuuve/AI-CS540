the
report
touches
upon
the
impact
of
artificial
intelligence
on
each
and
every
domain
that
would
be
affected
by
the
advent
of
ai
systems
.
it
goes
on
to
touch
upon
the
current
education
system
and
mentions
that
computer
based
learning
systems
are
not
likely
to
fully
replace
human
teaching
in
schools
.
i
would
like
to
challenge
this
school
of
thought
.
with
the
advent
of
massive
open
online
courses
-lrb-
moocs
-rrb-
and
the
interactive
learning
software
that
comes
with
it
,
the
formal
classroom
education
is
losing
its
importance
.
two
very
important
points
to
be
noted
here
are
the
best
colleges
today
have
low
acceptance
rates
and
not
everyone
can
secure
an
admission
.
secondly
not
all
are
fortunate
enough
to
afford
the
college
fees
.
the
best
option
that
they
have
is
to
turn
to
moocs
for
help
.
moreover
,
if
history
has
taught
us
anything
,
we
know
that
there
is
unrealized
talent
in
every
hinterland
of
developing
nations
.
the
moocs
aggregate
the
best
courses
offered
in
a
particular
college
and
make
it
available
for
public
consumption
.
two
main
advantages
of
this
approach
are
these
courses
can
be
taken
from
the
comfort
of
your
home
and
moreover
they
can
be
taken
again
and
again
till
you
attain
expertise
in
the
particular
subject
that
you
are
trying
to
master
.
the
designers
,
coders
,
managers
and
other
professionals
of
the
future
would
have
an
ebook
reader
,
nlp
based
interactive
tutor
and
evaluator
who
would
guide
them
at
every
step
of
their
professional
journey
.
learning
analytics
to
help
understand
how
a
particular
child
or
adult
learns
more
efficiently
and
effectively
rather
than
just
following
the
traditional
methods
of
teaching
which
are
not
able
to
provide
personalized
attention
.
the
report
also
mentions
that
teaching
robots
and
kits
that
accompany
those
could
be
fun
and
engaging
,
but
they
don
t
necessarily
improve
student
s
academic
performance
.
but
as
the
focus
of
future
learning
would
shift
from
mere
pedantry
to
using
the
available
inferences
from
existing
ai
systems
-lrb-
correct
with
a
very
high
probability
-rrb-
to
create
something
that
didn
t
exist
before
.
your
academic
excellence
would
be
judged
,
not
by
your
ability
to
process
and
reproduce
information
,
but
your
ability
to
think
,
create
and
contribute
.
the
report
also
talks
about
job
loss
due
to
ai
systems
.
but
as
the
quest
for
better
ai
systems
continues
,
there
would
always
be
jobs
wherein
the
ai
systems
need
to
be
bettered
.
the
resulting
products
would
be
free
from
human
error
and
hence
result
in
fewer
rejects
at
the
quality
assurance
stage
.
which
would
in
turn
reduce
the
cost
of
manufacturing
the
product
.
this
would
result
in
the
salaries
of
the
people
involved
to
be
almost
unaffected
.
of
course
,
that
said
,
the
aforementioned
is
an
ideal
scenario
and
the
execution
will
have
its
set
of
challenges
,
but
inclusive
growth
would
not
be
a
distant
dream
if
we
try
hard
enough
.
another
point
that
is
worth
touching
upon
is
that
,
the
report
rightly
mentions
that
children
often
appear
to
be
genuinely
happier
playing
at
home
rather
than
outside
with
their
friends
.
but
if
one
looks
at
this
situation
counterintuitively
,
we
could
develop
a
system
that
would
monitor
children
s
activity
and
stop
functioning
altogether
until
the
child
records
enough
physical
activity
on
his
or
her
fitness
tracker
or
may
be
the
parent
approves
the
right
amount
of
social
interaction
with
his
or
her
friends
.
in
conclusion
,
i
would
like
to
say
that
ai
is
definitely
going
to
affect
the
present
and
future
of
mankind
.
so
instead
of
worrying
