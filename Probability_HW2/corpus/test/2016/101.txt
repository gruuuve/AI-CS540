with
the
progression
of
artificial
intelligence
over
the
past
15
years
,
there
are
many
innovations
to
be
excited
about
.
while
the
``
stanford
100
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
highlights
many
of
the
positive
aspects
of
a
growing
ai
industry
,
i
argue
that
it
fails
to
adequately
address
the
loss
of
jobs
that
will
follow
this
revolution
.
automation
has
already
encroached
on
many
``
blue-collar
''
jobs
within
manufacturing
,
but
with
the
onset
of
``
white-collar
''
jobs
being
automated
as
well
through
ail
,
i
believe
that
additional
steps
will
need
to
be
taken
to
prevent
the
loss
of
livelihood
for
many
people
around
the
world
.
although
society
is
still
a
few
years
away
from
ai
starting
to
replace
jobs
in
large
quantities
,
when
the
time
comes
,
steps
will
need
to
be
in
place
to
help
those
without
a
livelihood
.
while
the
100
year
study
mentions
that
jobs
will
be
affected
for
some
people
,
this
point
seems
rather
glossed
over
,
and
the
explanation
that
other
jobs
will
be
created
through
automation
is
the
main
solution
.
i
disagree
that
this
is
an
acceptable
answer
,
as
ai
will
eventually
move
into
just
about
every
field
,
taking
away
enough
jobs
such
that
a
large
deficit
will
arise
.
from
medical
fields
moving
towards
full
automation
,
to
self-driving
vehicles
taking
over
the
transportation
industry
,
a
social
wellness
net
needs
to
be
implemented
,
or
at
least
discussed
at
length
,
sooner
rather
than
later
.
one
solution
that
comes
to
mind
is
shared
ownership
of
ai
,
such
that
the
value
these
machines
produce
is
split
among
the
populace
of
each
country
where
they
are
being
run
.
this
would
provide
those
who
have
lost
jobs
to
provide
for
themselves
,
potentially
giving
them
time
to
move
into
another
field
.
the
main
purpose
of
such
a
system
is
to
prevent
all
wealth
from
ai
work
being
accumulated
by
one
individual
or
corporation
,
which
would
have
serious
consequences
on
wealth
distribution
among
the
world
.
another
option
would
be
a
universal
basic
income
,
where
all
people
living
in
a
country
receive
some
amount
of
money
with
which
to
live
off
,
and
can
be
attributed
to
the
value
added
by
ai
work
.
this
idea
is
a
more
extreme
version
of
the
previous
,
but
will
be
more
important
to
look
into
as
ai
jobs
become
more
widespread
.
while
such
a
solution
does
not
need
to
be
implemented
immediately
,
or
even
in
the
near
future
,
it
is
vital
that
this
discussion
takes
place
.
