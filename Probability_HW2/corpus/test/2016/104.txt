the
100
year
stanford
report
on
artificial
intelligence
has
shown
how
ai
would
improve
our
lives
in
different
perspectives
,
such
as
transportation
,
health
care
,
education
,
public
safety
and
so
on
.
however
,
my
question
is
,
in
30
years
,
are
we
really
going
to
feel
that
our
life
get
better
?
are
we
certain
that
ai
would
not
add
more
chaos
in
the
future
?
we
utilize
ai
to
do
human
tasks
that
can
be
learned
and
acquired
,
relying
on
a
certain
level
of
cognitive
skills
,
but
with
a
traceable
pattern
.
we
no
longer
need
post
office
workers
to
read
the
digits
of
zip
codes
when
sorting
mail
.
soon
enough
,
we
wo
n't
need
pharmacists
to
fill
out
our
prescriptions
,
radiologists
to
interpret
our
x-rays
,
lawyers
to
analyze
legal
documents
or
accountants
to
do
our
taxes
.
the
automation
revolution
laid
off
a
majority
of
blue-colar
work
force
,
and
this
time
,
ai
is
going
to
hit
hard
a
wide
range
of
white-colar
jobs
.
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
their
career
when
replaced
by
intelligent
robots
?
learn
how
to
program
so
that
they
can
do
maintenance
work
on
the
machines
that
take
their
jobs
away
?
how
are
we
going
to
handle
the
scenarios
when
tons
of
people
are
losing
their
jobs
?
there
has
already
been
several
riots
around
the
world
organized
by
angry
cab
drivers
,
since
people
would
prefer
uber
these
days
,
an
ai
application
in
public
transportation
.
now
imagine
riots
from
a
good
chunk
of
the
work
forces
.
as
powerful
as
ai
,
when
used
by
an
evil
source
,
it
could
be
very
detrimental
.
the
report
gave
an
example
on
how
reasoning
with
social
networks
can
help
the
information
to
get
circulated
better
and
influence
more
people
in
that
network
.
it
was
used
for
homeless
youth
in
los
angeles
with
a
good
intention
to
help
them
.
what
if
someone
use
this
model
to
spread
racist
comments
among
teenagers
?
it
would
maximize
the
influence
,
only
this
time
,
it
's
a
bad
one
.
ai
does
not
have
morality
that
distinguish
from
right
or
wrong
.
one
can
argue
that
nuclear
weapon
would
have
the
same
attribute
,
but
ai
can
have
a
more
diverse
impact
on
our
lives
given
its
wide
application
.
my
last
concern
is
if
we
are
going
to
feel
comfortable
with
ai
.
they
are
intelligent
,
but
are
they
emotionally
intelligent
?
when
i
rant
to
siri
about
how
terrible
my
day
has
been
,
can
she
understand
it
and
sympathize
with
me
?
when
i
go
to
dr.
robot
for
health
issue
,
would
i
feel
hurt
because
he
wo
n't
show
any
concern
?
when
i
check
out
at
the
grocery
store
,
would
i
miss
the
small
talks
with
the
nice
cashier
lady
?
more
ais
in
our
lives
means
less
human-to-human
interaction
.
maybe
an
intelligent
robot
can
analyze
my
words
and
speech
pattern
,
label
my
emotion
and
tell
me
``
oh
dear
,
you
feel
sad
today
.
i
'm
sorry
for
you
.
''
but
will
that
really
make
me
feel
any
better
?
ai
surely
can
make
our
life
more
efficient
,
but
an
efficient
and
productive
life
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
happy
one
.

i
wrote
it
only
from
the
point
of
challenging
the
report
,
personally
,
i
love
ai
,
and
i
would
love
to
have
a
robot
friend
!
