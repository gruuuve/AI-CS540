the
current
and
future
advancements
in
artificial
intelligence
are
attempting
to
make
the
machinesore
human-aware
,
according
to
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
.
this
is
also
the
way
that
hollywood
portrays
different
intelligent
machines
throughout
many
of
their
productions
.
throughout
these
dramas
though
the
machines
become
too
humanized
and
learn
to
live
by
basic
human
instincts
without
regard
for
the
safety
of
the
humans
they
were
meant
to
serve
.
although
the
goal
is
to
ultimately
generate
human-awareness
in
these
machines
the
study
also
states
,
unlike
in
the
movies
,
there
is
no
race
of
superhuman
robots
on
the
horizon
or
probably
even
possible
.
this
brings
up
the
most
controversial
issue
to
do
with
artificial
intelligence
,
which
is
the
safety
of
the
users
of
the
machine
.
there
are
many
applications
for
automated
machines
in
which
the
wrong
decision
could
lead
to
an
injury
of
the
owner
or
user
of
the
machine
.
a
major
example
of
where
this
could
occur
is
in
the
sector
of
transportation
.
certain
functionality
of
automobiles
have
already
been
added
to
many
vehicles
that
demonstrate
how
different
systems
can
allow
cars
to
perform
functions
that
did
not
used
to
be
available
in
commercial
vehicles
.
some
of
these
functionalities
provide
warnings
to
oncoming
cars
or
even
help
the
driver
break
pre-collision
systems
that
let
cars
autonomously
brake
when
risk
of
a
collision
is
detected
.
a
whole
new
aspect
to
the
automotive
industry
is
the
self-driving
car
.
many
large
technology
companies
have
begun
research
and
development
on
a
product
that
can
drive
without
any
control
of
a
human
.
in
eight
short
years
,
from
2004-2012
,
speedy
and
surprising
progress
occurred
in
both
academia
and
industry
,
and
the
article
predicts
that
by
2020
self-driving
cars
will
be
widely
adopted
.
they
make
this
claim
,
supporting
it
by
saying
,
in
the
near
future
,
sensing
algorithms
will
achieve
super-human
performance
for
capabilities
required
for
driving
.
after
first
claiming
that
machines
were
not
close
to
achieving
superhuman
performance
,
it
is
clear
that
there
is
still
a
lot
of
work
that
will
need
to
be
done
.
many
of
these
issues
arise
because
of
ethical
,
moral
,
and
legal
dilemmas
that
can
not
be
decided
without
a
human
point
of
view
,
since
machines
do
not
have
the
same
consequences
as
a
human
would
.
in
certain
situations
where
a
crash
is
inevitable
people
make
split
second
decisions
in
order
to
avoid
as
much
damage
as
possible
.
machines
can
be
programmed
to
attempt
to
avoid
the
least
amount
of
contact
with
other
vehicles
or
buildings
as
possible
,
but
can
not
process
the
aftermath
of
what
will
occur
.
there
will
be
other
situations
in
which
the
result
of
a
crash
will
be
the
same
just
effect
different
people
and
once
again
the
machine
will
not
understand
the
human
morals
,
or
legal
standpoint
of
what
will
happen
.
the
article
does
state
that
it
is
not
yet
clear
how
much
better
self-driving
cars
need
to
become
to
encourage
broad
acceptance
,
but
the
prediction
of
a
wide
acceptance
by
2020
would
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
.
even
after
the
cars
are
fully
functional
the
companies
still
need
to
determine
how
liability
is
distributed
.
