in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
the
report
lays
out
the
current
progress
in
the
eight
domains
of
the
ai
field
,
and
it
also
states
the
prospects
and
implications
of
future
advancements
in
ai
.
however
,
while
the
report
mentions
the
possible
problems
over
certain
aspects
of
ai
as
new
technologies
are
developed
and
utilized
,
examples
including
privacy
,
ethics
,
and
bias
,
the
report
does
not
offer
concrete
solutions
or
plans
to
combat
such
concerns
,
but
merely
address
the
issues
broadly
by
admitting
their
existence
without
offering
ways
to
solve
such
problems
.
in
other
words
,
the
report
does
not
answer
the
question
how
to
implement
the
solutions
?
.
additionally
,
the
report
has
empirical
conclusions
based
on
hypotheticals
but
not
specific
evidence
.
first
,
as
stated
in
the
report
,
in
the
public
security
domain
,
ai
has
the
potential
problems
of
violating
people
s
privacy
and
discriminatory
behaviors
due
to
bias
of
application
designers
and
the
type
of
data
they
choose
.
the
report
simply
suggests
that
policies
should
enforce
ai
developers
to
avoid
bias
and
that
privacy
is
a
concern
in
usage
of
ai
,
but
it
neither
provides
how
bias
can
be
eliminated
nor
how
to
utilize
ai
in
a
way
not
to
breach
people
s
privacy
rights
.
furthermore
,
in
the
healthcare
domain
,
the
report
confidently
claims
that
in
fifteen
years
,
ai
can
change
the
cognitive
tasks
assigned
to
human
clinicians

with
sufficient
data
and
systems
.
however
,
there
was
no
empirical
evidence
offered
in
the
report
to
support
the
claim
,
because
there
is
no
evidence
thus
no
certainty
that
there
will
be
sufficient
data
and
systems
,
so
the
claim
is
merely
a
conclusion
drawn
on
hypotheticals
only
and
can
not
be
used
to
predict
the
future
of
ai
.
moreover
,
in
the
employment
domain
,
the
report
is
falsely
confident
that
by
incorporating
ai
technologies
in
people
s
daily
lives
,
not
only
new
jobs
will
be
created
and
cost
of
living
will
decrease
.
nevertheless
,
the
report
fails
to
consider
that
people
whose
jobs
will
be
replaced
by
ai
are
low
to
mid
level
blue-collar
jobs
,
yet
the
prospects
of
new
jobs
are
still
uncertain
,
so
how
can
people
be
optimistic
about
the
future
of
ai
when
they
are
unsure
whether
the
new
jobs
created
as
a
result
will
give
them
the
standard
of
living
in
which
they
desire
.
also
,
the
report
claims
with
lowered
human
labor
as
a
result
of
ai
,
the
cost
of
living
will
decrease
,
yet
the
machinery
designed
from
ai
technologies
still
need
money
to
be
regularly
maintained
,
how
can
the
public
be
sure
that
machinery
costs
will
be
lower
than
the
current
human
labor
cost
?
lastly
,
in
the
education
domain
,
the
report
only
mentions
the
advantages
of
ai
such
as
flexible
and
personalized
learning
environment
when
students
interact
with
the
learning
material
virtually
.
but
,
the
study
fails
to
consider
the
interpersonal
relationship
and
emotional
support
students
normally
gain
from
conventional
classrooms
and
that
cost
of
ai
studying
tools
is
not
financial
affordable
for
everyone
,
which
creates
further
inequality
and
achievement
gap
contrary
to
democratic
ideals
.
since
the
study
panel
who
composed
the
report
is
currently
one
of
the
most
authoritative
and
coordinated
voices
in
assessing
the
state
of
ai
,
without
their
specific
suggestions
to
overcoming
the
obstacles
that
advancements
in
ai
would
pose
and
with
them
steering
the
public
toward
questionable
future
based
on
hypotheticals
,
the
society
at
large
is
left
in
a
difficult
position
of
accepting
inevitable
changes
emerged
with
ai
advancements
yet
unable
to
combat
any
downsides
of
these
developments
.
