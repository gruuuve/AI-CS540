according
to
stanford
's
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
when
self-driving
cars
become
better
drivers
than
humans
,
humans
will
own
less
cars
,
live
further
from
work
,
and
become
more
reliant
on
public
transportation
.
this
claim
is
grounded
upon
the
assumption
that
people
buy
cars
simply
to
drive
-
to
go
from
point
a
to
point
b.
however
,
that
's
not
the
main
reason
people
buy
cars
.
they
buy
multiple
cars
because
its
convenient
for
their
family
.
for
every
family
,
there
's
conflict
.
someone
has
to
go
to
school
,
work
,
clubs
,
parks
,
other
houses
and
each
has
a
different
route
;
therefore
mornings
are
stressful
.
adding
waiting
for
a
self-driving
car
to
the
list
of
tasks
a
parent
has
to
do
would
be
catastrophic
;
hence
it
's
far
more
likely
a
family
would
just
buy
multiple
self-driving
cars
for
their
own
convenient
use
.
in
addition
,
people
do
n't
like
public
transportation
due
to
issues
percieved
to
be
the
fault
of
the
transit
agency
,
according
to
forbes
.
even
with
self-driving
vehicles
replacing
buses
,
people
still
would
n't
use
public
transit
,
for
if
the
vehicles
had
mechanical
failures
,
did
n't
reach
the
stop
on
time
,
crashed
into
a
vehicle
or
a
civilian
,
or
any
other
percieved
issue
,
people
would
lose
all
interest
in
the
public
transportation
system
.
therefore
,
with
respect
to
transportation
,
nothing
would
change
except
families
'
cars
would
be
replaced
with
modern
self-driving
ones
.
in
addition
,
the
stanford
study
panel
,
the
writers
of
this
report
,
proposed
a
three
step
process
for
ai
:
1
.
define
a
path
toward
accruing
technical
expertise
in
ai
at
all
levels
of
government
.
effective
governance
requires
more
experts
who
understand
and
can
analyze
the
interactions
between
ai
technologies
,
programmatic
objectives
,
and
overall
societal
values
.
2
.
remove
the
perceived
and
actual
impediments
to
research
on
the
fairness
,
security
,
privacy
,
and
social
impacts
of
ai
systems
.
3
.
increase
public
and
private
funding
for
interdisciplinary
studies
of
the
societal
impacts
of
ai
.
there
are
issues
with
step
1
and
step
2
.
in
giving
government
the
ability
to
understand
and
analyze
interactions
between
ai
technologies
and
society
,
officials
would
then
understand
the
implications
of
technological
advances
both
foreseen
by
the
inventor
and
unforseen
.
what
the
panel
hopes
is
by
being
informed
,
the
government
will
make
the
right
decision
,
the
decision
to
benefit
society
-
but
there
have
been
times
,
dark
times
,
where
a
government
was
corrupt
and
essentially
made
society
suffer
trough
its
decisions
.
if
step
1
follows
through
,
what
's
stopping
a
dark
government
from
using
the
new
knowledge
they
have
gleaned
for
nefarious
purposes
,
such
as
spying
on
the
populace
without
its
knowledge
or
using
the
technology
to
target
or
terrorize
a
set
or
subset
of
citizens
?
now
step
2
.
the
issue
with
step
2
is
it
allows
society
to
reverse
engineer
and
evaluate
ai
systems
.
the
study
panel
's
purpose
for
removing
the
impediments
is
for
researchers
to
find
security
vulnerabilites
and
patch
up
privacy
concerns
;
however
,
that
's
assuming
researchers
will
report
and
patch
issues
.
a
consequence
of
removing
the
impediments
is
it
could
allow
hackers
to
figure
out
how
an
