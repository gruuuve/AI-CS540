the
authors
dream
of
a
radically
different
future
.
they
hope
that
in

will
significantly
supplement
human

the
writers
acknowledge
concerns
that
ai
will
lead
to
higher
unemployment
rates
,
and
attempt
to
lessen
these
fears
by
painting
an
idealistic
picture
of
the
future
.
however
,
if
these
hopes
became
reality
,
the
affects
would
compromise
the
new
industry
s
success
.
if
machines
with
artificial
intelligence
replace
human
laborers
,
new
jobs
must
be
found
for
the
displaced
workers
.
the
authors
of
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in

propose
that
new
work
will
open
up
naturally
with
the
shifting
employment
landscape
(39)
the
prospect
of
a
new
job
market
is
exciting
.
however
,
for
those
who
slip
through
the
cracks
,
the
writers
take
a
step
further
.
longer
term
,
the
current
social
safety
net
may
need
to
evolve
into
better
social
services
for
everyone
,
such
as
healthcare
or
education
,
or
a
guaranteed
basic
income
ai
may
be
thought
of
as
a
radically
different
mechanism
of
wealth
creation
in
which
everyone
is
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
world
s
ai-produced
treasure
(39)
.
ai
technology
will
likely
boost
the
economy
.
however
,
if
carried
out
,
these
suggested
actions
would
be
detrimental
to
ai
.
in
order
for
the
capital
generated
from
ai
technology
to
support
national
programs
,
the
government
would
have
to
tax
ai
companies
heavily
.
the
cost
of
a
guaranteed
basic
income
is
staggering
.
according
to
michael
tanner
,
in
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
guaranteed
national
income
,
spread
over
296
million
u.s.
citizens
,
the
cost
of
such
a
program
would
be
nearly
$
4.4
trillion
,
more
than
our
entire
federal
budget
today
,
and
more
than
4
times
our
current
welfare
expenditure
(15)
.
american
companies
already
suffer
from
high
taxes
,
and
many
are
redomiciling
to
other
countries
to
evade
taxes
-lrb-

.
raising
taxes
further
could
either
drive
more
companies
away
,
or
stifle
innovation
.
ai
companies
may
struggle
to
survive
the
heavy
tax
load
,
and
give
up
the
fight
.
this
would
slow
ai
s
progress
.
however
,
even
if
ai
technology
managed
to
fund
a
strong
social
safety
net
,
this
may
not
benefit
society
as
much
as
hoped
.
free
social
programs
could
cause
societal
decay
.
if
people
received
a
guaranteed
basic
income
,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
were
employed
,
many
would
lose
their
motivation
to
work
.
michael
tanner
states
,
any
program
that
provides
income
without
linking
it
to
work
will
discourage
work
to
some
extent
(19)
.
even
if
their
labor
were
no
longer
required
,
the
worker
s
creativity
would
be
lost
to
society
.
also
,
if
it
were
unnecessary
to
earn
a
living
,
many
people
would
forgo
a
college
education
.
many
would
remain
untrained
in
professional
fields
,
which
would
mean
the
loss
of
potential
innovators
.
if
this
happened
,
policy
makers
would
have
used
the
benefits
of
ai
technology
to
inadvertently
slow
its
progress
.
people
with
the
potential
to
revolutionize
ai
would
never
be
introduced
to
the
field
.
while
it
is
exciting
to
think
about
the
ways
ai
will
change
the
job
market
,
the
government
should
respond
carefully
to
this
new
source
of
wealth
.
in
order
for
the
ai
market
to
provide
its
full
benefit
,
it
should
not
be
burdened
with
the
nation
s
wellbeing
.
ai
has
the
potential
to
provide
new
jobs
while
transforming
the
look
of
everyday
life
.
however
,
the
new
industry
needs
to
be
protected
from
being
crushed
under
the
weight
of
national
programs
,
or
growing
stagnant
in
a
lax
society
.
instead
,
it
should
be
given
the
freedom
to
grow
in
a
free
market
,
where
it
will
not
be
penalized
for
succeeding
