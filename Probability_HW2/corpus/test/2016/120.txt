the
advancement
of
ai
will
no
doubt
bring
about
many
benefits
to
a
wide
variety
of
people
.
however
,
this
will
not
be
without
sacrifice
.
while
it
is
easy
to
imagine
more
conveniences
such
as
self-driving
cars
,
ride
share
apps
and
robots
to
perform
manual
labor
tasks
,
this
will
destroy
the
livelihood
of
people
who
rely
on
related
professions
for
employment
.
as
a
result
,
jobs
such
as
taxi
drivers
and
jobs
in
manufacturing
will
no
longer
exist
.
this
will
unfortunately
disenfranchise
the
portion
of
the
population
that
has
relied
on
these
types
of
positions
to
provide
them
with
an
income
.
the
report
mentions
this
problem
by
saying
``
each
domain
faces
varied
ai-related
challenges
,
including
...
the
challenge
of
overcoming
fears
of
marginalizing
humans
''
but
glosses
over
its
significance
.
with
a
larger
and
larger
segment
of
the
population
disenfranchised
as
the
prevalence
of
artificial
intelligence
grows
,
there
becomes
a
greater
likelihood
of
backlash
.
the
article
acknowledges
this
notion
by
asserting
,
``
at
the
same
time
,
many
of
these
developments
will
spur
disruptions
in
how
human
labor
is
augmented
or
replaced
by
ai
,
creating
new
challenges
for
the
economy
and
society
more
broadly
.
''
while
this
argument
is
more
political
in
nature
,
i
believe
its
affects
are
significant
,
but
ai
may
be
able
to
provide
a
solution
.
the
effect
of
artificial
intelligence
disenfranchising
segments
of
the
population
may
result
in
more
and
more
attacks
that
target
technologies
or
businesses
and
people
that
develop
technologies
that
cause
such
disenfranchisement
.
this
in
effect
creates
a
direct
threat
to
human
kind
thus
refuting
the
article
's
claim
,
``
contrary
to
the
more
fantastic
predictions
for
artificial
intelligence
in
the
popular
press
,
the
study
panel
found
no
cause
for
concern
that
artificial
intelligence
is
an
imminent
threat
to
humankind
.
''
in
addition
to
this
,
increased
accessibility
to
ai
technologies
via
the
internet
will
encourage
the
use
of
ai
for
nefarious
purposes
.
with
the
advancement
of
technology
,
there
has
always
been
an
increase
in
the
use
of
technology
for
iniquitous
purposes
.
such
is
evident
from
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
to
the
increased
frequency
of
cyber
attacks
.
the
increased
access
to
artificial
intelligence
technologies
will
result
in
an
increased
frequency
of
attacks
or
incidents
that
may
threaten
the
safety
of
large
portions
of
the
population
.
this
increased
use
of
artificial
intelligence
for
nefarious
purposes
may
be
particularly
devastating
when
applied
to
the
financial
sector
.
with
high
frequency
trading
becoming
more
common
and
more
and
more
high
frequency
trading
firms
using
ai
to
give
their
platforms
a
leg
up
by
implementing
predictive
trading
,
it
is
likely
that
trading
firms
may
deploy
high
frequency
trading
software
that
has
severe
negative
economic
impacts
either
intentionally
to
benefit
their
bottom
line
or
unintentionally
.
economic
events
such
as
the
flash
crash
in
2010
where
the
dow
jones
lost
almost
a
thousand
points
in
36
minutes
may
become
more
common
and
more
impactful
.
with
the
increase
of
jobs
being
automated
away
by
ai
there
will
be
an
increased
need
for
people
with
proper
technical
education
and
background
to
maintain
the
these
ai
systems
and
improve
upon
them
.
this
provides
an
opportunity
for
ai
to
be
the
solution
to
this
lack
of
technical
labor
.
the
article
mentions
,
``
natural
language
processing
,
machine
learning
,
and
crowdsourcing
have
boosted
online
learning
and
enabled
teachers
in
higher
education
to
multiply
the
size
of
their
classrooms
while
addressing
individual
students
'
learning
needs
and
styles
.
''
personalized
,
affordable
,
accessible
online
education
will
be
the
wave
of
the
future
and
likely
one
of
the
most
significant
applications
of
ai
.
with
more
people
receiving
technical
training
and
education
,
there
will
be
more
perspectives
on
how
to
build
and
implement
ai
in
our
everyday
lives
.
this
increase
in
perspective
will
undoubtedly
result
in
advancements
that
will
combat
and
far
out
shadow
the
negative
affects
of
artificial
intelligence
,
as
we
know
it
.
