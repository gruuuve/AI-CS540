america
's
law
enforcement
is
vital
to
our
nation
's
safety
and
welfare
.
a
public
service
that
wields
potentially
deadly
force
must
be
consistent
and
precise
.
in
the
100
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
the
standing
committee
reported
their
views
on
how
artificial
intelligence
would
progress
by
the
year
2030
.
one
of
the
areas
they
believe
will
expand
is
the
use
of
ai
in
law
enforcement
.
i
do
not
believe
ai
will
take
a
significant
place
in
law
enforcement
in
the
near
future
,
not
due
of
the
technological
limitations
,
but
because
of
society
's
inherent
bias
against
machines
and
the
american
public
's
currently
volatile
view
of
law
enforcement
.
media
has
given
the
public
quite
a
few
potentially
reasonable
fears
for
allowing
ai
in
a
position
of
power
.
for
example
,
in
robocop
(1987)
,
one
of
the
first
scenes
depicts
a
prototype
crime
fighting
robot
suffering
a
glitch
and
graphically
murdering
an
innocent
during
a
demonstration
.
the
100
year
study
specifically
mentions
another
film
,
minority
report
(2002)
where
a
crime
prediction
robot
commands
the
police
to
arrest
an
apparently
innocent
person
.
this
trend
is
still
prevalent
in
films
today
,
such
as
avengers
:
age
of
ultron
(2015)
where
an
ai
is
created
to
help
the
titular
heroes
fight
crime
,
but
instead
it
decides
to
wipe
out
the
human
race
moments
after
gaining
sentience
.
while
these
depictions
of
ai
are
fictitious
,
films
can
actually
drive
the
public
mindset
.
in
steven
spielberg
's
famous
film
jaws
(1975)
,
a
vengeful
great
white
shark
goes
on
a
rampage
,
viciously
killing
and
eating
several
people
.
this
film
is
cited
by
many
,
including
george
burgess
,
the
director
of
the
florida
program
for
shark
research
,
as
one
of
the
causes
of
the
rapid
shark
population
decline
in
the
last
few
decades
.
sharks
are
now
widely
viewed
as
evil
,
even
though
reported
incidents
of
shark
attacks
are
incredibly
rare
.
in
the
same
way
,
powerful
robots
are
almost
always
depicted
as
unpredictable
at
best
,
and
antagonistic
at
worst
.
while
robots
may
someday
have
a
place
in
law
enforcement
,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
be
any
time
soon
.
the
public
already
has
an
uneasy
view
of
ai
,
so
the
currently
volatile
field
of
law
enforcement
is
sure
to
be
slow
to
adopt
it
.
police-public
relationships
are
now
incredibly
tense
after
a
string
of
allegedly
unjustified
and
racist
killings
of
suspects
by
police
officers
.
most
notably
,
the
recent
milwaukee
riots
have
been
working
to
raise
awareness
and
seek
justice
for
those
who
have
been
killed
.
whether
or
not
their
mission
is
justified
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
paper
,
however
scenarios
like
this
certainly
make
the
integration
of
new
and
potentially
dangerous
technology
into
law
enforcement
risky
.
the
report
acknowledges
that
a
law
enforcement
ai
could
potentially
be
biased
if
given
biased
data
,
but
even
if
the
ai
could
be
perfectly
unbiased
,
it
likely
would
n't
be
viewed
as
such
,
prompting
outrage
any
time
there
was
apparent
bias
.
this
would
surely
interfere
with
the
progress
of
ai
integration
on
a
wide
scale
.
in
conclusion
,
a
service
with
as
high
of
stakes
as
law
enforcement
will
not
be
quickly
integrated
with
ai
.
the
current
state
of
the
american
public
is
not
conducive
for
a
technology
as
new
and
misunderstood
as
ai
.
for
the
coming
years
,
it
will
be
humans
enforcing
their
own
laws
.
