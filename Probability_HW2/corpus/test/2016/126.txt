i
challenge
the
idea
that
the
typical
north
american
city
will
use
ai
technology
to
monitor
u.s.
citizens
for
public
safety
.
government
surveillance
is
always
a
difficult
issue
.
in
the
interest
of
national
security
,
several
government
agencies
such
as
the
national
security
agency
-lrb-
nsa
-rrb-
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
monitor
communications
made
by
american
citizens
.
however
,
americans
value
their
privacy
and
openly
protest
surveillance
by
their
own
government
.
the
privacy
act
of
1974
was
created
tolimit
what
kind
of
personal
information
can
be
collected
and
utilized
by
a
government
agency
.
the
american
civil
liberties
union
-lrb-
ucla
-rrb-
is
a
non-profit
organization
that
fights
for
civil
liberties
in
the
u.s.
according
to
their
website
,
the
ucla
plans
to
stop
the
government
agencies
from
using
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
spy
on
citizens
.
lots
of
americans
already
hate
the
current
government
surveillance
.
ai
surveillance
will
increase
the
citizens
'
mistrust
for
the
government
.
the
study
mentioned
technology
that
can
scan
twitter
and
other
social
media
in
order
to
find
behavior
associated
with
terrorism
and
prevent
indoctrination
into
violent
groups
.
many
citizens
already
oppose
to
the
surveillance
of
their
public
records
,
phone
calls
,
and
emails
,
so
they
will
also
oppose
to
the
surveillance
of
their
social
media
even
though
many
terrorist
groups
recruit
via
social
media
.
many
people
are
also
afraid
of
being
unjustly
accused
based
on
prejudices
.
the
study
mentions
the
use
of
predictive
policing
.
in
the
current
political
climate
,
many
people
are
worried
about
being
targeted
by
institutional
racism
and
police
brutality
.
the
``
black
lives
matter
''
social
movement
is
just
one
example
of
the
people
's
reaction
to
their
paranoia
.
according
to
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
,
58.8
%
of
inmates
are
caucasian
while
37.7
%
of
inmates
are
african
american
as
of
30
july
2016
.

if
the
ai
surveillance
software
learns
using
patterns
and
takes
race
,
religion
,
and
ethnicity
into
consideration
,
it
might
start
targeting
certain
groups
unjustly
.
when
the
people
are
afraid
,
the
government
will
not
support
their
fears
,
so
government
funding
will
be
severely
limited
.
the
report
recognizes
that
gaining
the
public
's
trust
is
crucial
for
development
of
ai
.
