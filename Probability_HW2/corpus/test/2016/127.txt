the
first
write
up
for
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
is
a
very
well
designed
and
educated
piece
.
every
aspect
of
the
study
has
been
given
significant
thought
and
uses
real
world
evidence
to
back
up
it
's
claims
.
i
firmly
belive
that
all
of
the
predictions
given
in
the
report
are
correct
,
except
for
one
.
education
will
not
advance
as
fast
as
predicted
.
this
report
claims
that
in
the
next
15
years
,
``
ai
technologies
to
assist
teachers
in
the
classroom
and
in
the
home
is
likely
to
expand
significantly
,
as
will
learning
based
on
virtual
reality
applications
.
''
it
also
explains
that
,
``
more
general
and
more
sophisticated
virtual
reality
scenarios
in
which
students
can
immerse
themselves
in
subjects
from
all
disciplines
will
be
developed
.
''
the
article
backs
up
this
claim
by
sighting
significant
ai
advanments
in
the
classroom
that
already
exist
.
however
,
these
special
advanced
methods
of
learning
are
currently
only
deployed
in
a
very
small
amount
of
locations
,
and
even
the
schools
that
are
lucky
enough
to
obtain
this
technology
do
not
have
enough
resources
to
provide
for
all
of
their
students
.
currently
,
education
is
in
a
crisis
.
public
schools
do
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
teachers
a
livable
salary
and
in
this
state
,
ai
does
not
have
room
to
advance
to
the
point
of
being
a
staple
in
the
average
classroom
.
this
is
not
to
say
that
ai
in
education
will
not
advance
at
all
.
i
agree
with
many
aspects
of
the
write
up
including
ai
use
in
higher
education
facilities
,
and
the
use
of
downloadable
software
.
these
advancements
will
not
be
impaired
by
budget
as
many
softwares
are
free
to
use
and
many
higher
education
facilities
,
such
as
air
force
training
,
have
the
resources
to
provide
this
new
technology
.
i
should
clarify
,
even
though
the
article
does
address
some
of
my
concerns
about
the
current
financial
situation
in
schools
,
i
feel
it
does
not
recognize
the
extent
to
which
many
schools
are
struggling
.
another
concern
of
mine
is
that
people
,
in
particular
parents
,
will
not
be
as
open
to
the
idea
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
classroom
as
the
article
suggests
.
many
people
who
have
not
had
significant
exposer
to
ai
will
hamper
it
's
advancment
.
the
idea
of
a
student
developing
through
the
use
of
a
robot
as
opposed
to
a
human
teacher
is
much
less
desirable
for
many
.
these
objections
will
work
to
significantly
slow
the
advancment
of
ai
in
the
classroom
,
and
will
result
in
much
less
progress
over
the
next
15
years
than
the
study
suggests
.
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
suggests
that
within
the
next
15
years
,
ai
will
completely
revolutionize
that
way
schooling
is
done
.
it
claims
that
new
advancements
will
quickly
enter
our
education
system
and
help
our
childeren
learn
and
develop
better
.
however
,
this
is
a
very
optimistic
view
.
the
combination
of
lower
funding
for
schools
and
objections
from
parents
will
stop
ai
from
taking
over
the
classroom
anytime
soon
.
