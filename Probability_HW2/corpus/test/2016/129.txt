the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
offers
many
interesting
and
exciting
topics
of
conversation
,
specifically
referring
to
how
artificial
intelligence
will
,
or
can
,
affect
industry
,
government
,
and
the
general
public
.
this
study
highlights
the
positive
and
negative
aspects
of
ai
that
mankind
can
expect
to
experience
within
the
next
two
decades
.
a
key
negative
consequence
of
improved
ai
is
the
potential
loss
of
jobs
as
automation
becomes
more
refined
and
applied
to
more
job
markets
.
another
consequence
in
relation
to
this
,
whether
seen
as
positive
or
negative
,
is
the
development
of
self-driving
cars
,
which
could
lead
to
less
automobile
accidents
and
more
efficient
delivery
systems
;
despite
the
positives
this
change
would
bring
,
many
people
could
be
negatively
affected
as
ai
would
reduce
the
need
for
taxi
drivers
or
other
transportation
related
jobs
.
the
idea
of
self-driving
cars
is
fascinating
,
and
they
will
influence
the
public
in
a
multitude
of
ways
.
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
goes
into
great
detail
about
the
possibilities
,
as
well
as
the
current
effectiveness
of
self-driving
cars
:
``
but
in
eight
short
years
,
from
2004-2012
,
speedy
and
surprising
progress
occurred
in
both
academia
and
industry
.
advances
in
sensing
technology
and
machine
learning
for
perception
tasks
has
sped
progress
and
,
as
a
result
,
google
's
autonomous
vehicles
and
tesla
's
semi-autonomous
cars
are
driving
on
city
streets
today
.

there
is
no
denying
the
fast-paced
progress
of
self-driving
cars
,
but
i
do
disagree
with
this
study
's
prediction
of
how
large
of
an
impact
these
vehicles
will
have
on
society
.
the
one
hundred
year
study
states
on
page
20
that
:
``
self-driving
cars
and
peer-to-peer
transportation
services
may
eliminate
the
need
to
own
a
vehicle
,
''
as
well
as
''
...
shared
autonomous
vehicles
--
people
using
cars
as
a
service
rather
than
owning
their
own
--
may
reduce
total
miles
.
''
i
do
not
believe
that
the
average
person
would
prefer
to
pay
a
fee
nearly
every
day
in
order
to
get
to
and
from
work
and
other
destinations
,
rather
than
drive
their
own
car
;
this
would
add
unneccessary
hassle
,
and
raises
other
concerns
.
what
happens
if
a
self-driving
car
is
late
to
arrive
to
your
house
,
which
results
in
you
being
late
for
work
?
if
the
car
is
involved
in
an
accident
and
you
are
injured
,
who
is
at
fault
?
if
such
a
situation
did
occur
,
it
would
cause
many
headaches
determining
who
or
what
is
at
fault
,
and
people
may
avoid
using
such
a
service
in
order
to
bypass
these
problems
.
i
believe
people
would
prefer
to
rely
on
themselves
and
their
own
vehicle
to
travel
,
and
that
the
need
to
own
a
vehicle
will
still
persist
within
the
next
two
decades
.
when
self-driving
cars
and
self-driven
transportation
companies
arise
,
i
predict
that
the
general
public
will
be
even
slower
to
adapt
and
accept
these
vehicles
as
a
viable
method
of
transportation
than
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
presumes
,
and
their
use
will
be
much
more
limited
than
hoped
for
.
the
study
is
optimistic
,
yet
seemingly
unrealistic
in
this
regard
,
in
my
opinion
.
whether
or
not
people
will
abandon
their
own
cars
in
favor
