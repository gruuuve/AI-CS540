in
the
report
's
broadness
of
presentation
,
it
failed
to
provide
interesting
depth
on
many
points
.
understandably
so
,
as
the
reports
intention
was
to
be
exactly
that
,
a
broad
informed
hypothesis
on
the
trajectory
of
ai
technologies
across
functions
.
i
have
chosen
to
elaborate
more
in
depth
on
two
topics
:
a
course
of
action
for
the
acceptance
and
integration
of
driverless
vehicles
and
a
discussion
of
how
ai
generated
wealth
should
be
considered
based
on
the
ai
's
development
and
learning
process
.
partially
integrated
to
completely
separate
streams
of
ai
interaction
will
likely
have
to
be
implemented
,
as
all-in-one
adoption
of
ai
solutions
is
essentially
impossible
.
the
report
consistently
reminded
the
reader
that
gradual
public
acceptance
is
necessary
for
optimal
advancement
in
ai
technology
.
with
regards
to
self-driving
vehicles
a
likely
first
step
will
evolve
with
the
emergence
of
``
driverless-vehicle-only
''
highways
,
streets
and
avenues
.
this
will
arise
due
to
practicality
as
well
as
general
and
progressive
popular
integration
in
society
.
practically
,
it
will
be
far
easier
for
programmers
to
design
systems
to
communicate
with
other
predictive
systems
--
in
our
case
``
self
driving
cars
''
--
than
to
code
edge
cases
of
random
and
odd
unpredictable
human
behavior
,
such
as
a
child
running
across
the
street
or
a
human
controlled
vehicle
making
an
unusual
maneuver
.
this
driverless-lane
should
also
drive
an
interest
in
the
public
incentivizing
acceptance
,
especially
if
these
lanes
are
intelligently
placed
.
imagine
a
driverless
lane
in
view
of
a
high
traffic
highway
where
drivers
can
witness
the
driverless
vehicles
zip
past
them
while
they
sit
in
adjacent
stagnant
traffic
.
such
placement
will
likely
encourage
acceptance
at
a
faster
pace
of
self-driving
vehicles
allowing
the
driverless
lanes
to
increase
progressively
overtaking
human
driver
lanes
.
if
the
lanes
are
adequately
protected
from
unpredictable
interference
--
such
as
keeping
bike
lanes
,
human
drivers
,
and
sidewalks
well
away
from
these
driverless
lanes
--
this
implementation
will
also
mitigate
legal
costs
with
regard
to
accidents
involving
driverless
vehicles
.
or
if
driverless
vehicles
get
into
accidents
,
it
will
likely
be
easier
to
determine
fault
because
the
accident
will
only
involve
other
driverless
vehicles
who
would
likely
have
reliable
data
regarding
the
vehicles
communication
and
faulty
decision
making
.
a
large
topic
within
the
report
deals
with
how
to
allocate
the
wealth
generated
by
ai
processes
,
and
the
likelihood
of
its
displacement
.
in
many
cases
ai
that
directly
interacts
with
humans
,
and
there
by
collects
data
on
humans
for
its
own
learning
arguably
owes
most
of
its
intelligence
to
the
humans
it
learns
from
.
large
databases
exist
from
which
ais
extrapolate
and
``
learn
''
which
allow
the
companies
creating
those
ais
to
profit
.
when
it
eventually
comes
to
these
ais
displacing
the
workers
from
which
they
have
garnered
the
data
,
it
would
seem
unfair
that
the
worker
should
suffer
when
the
worker
's
data
is
what
allowed
the
ai
to
grow
.
another
facet
of
the
problem
is
consent
for
the
data
taken
,
especially
when
a
company
benefits
monetarily
from
it
but
the
subject
does
not
.
look
to
the
example
of
research
studies
.
researchers
,
depending
on
budget
,
either
ask
the
public
for
volunteers
or
offer
to
pay
participants
.
as
wealth
generated
from
ai
and
user
tracking
grows
and
the
workforce
becomes
displaced
,
the
people
whom
the
data
is
based
on
arguably
will
be
owed
a
portion
of
the
wealth
generated
by
their
data
's
use
.
