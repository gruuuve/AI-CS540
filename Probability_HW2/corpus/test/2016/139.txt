the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
mostly
broad
claims
,
stating
that
the
advancements
in
ai
will
lead
to
advancements
in
most
of
the
given
fields
in
the
``
near
future
.
''
i
think
that
that
is
really
great
,
and
its
hard
to
disagree
with
vague
promises
,
so
instead
i
'm
going
to
challenge
their
very
optimistic
outlook
regarding
the
advancement
with
ai
in
the
field
of
transportation
.
they
claim
that
``
self-driving
cars
...
widely
adopted
by
2020
''

-rrb-
,
but
at
the
current
point
in
time
they
is
legislation
regarding
them
in
4
states
.
that
's
not
to
say
that
ai
advancements
in
cars
is
something
that
can
be
overshadowed
.
the
additions
made
in
manned
cars
such
as
intelegent
parking
and
highway
safety
measures
are
a
great
start
to
showing
that
current
cars
can
search
their
surroundings
and
handle
certain
jobs
by
themselves
.
however
,
if
a
person
is
driving
a
car
,
and
hits
another
car
because
there
was
a
glitch
in
the
blind
spot
monitoring
system
,
that
person
is
to
blame
for
the
accident
,
and
legal
actions
can
be
taken
swiftly
.
since
no
person
is
driving
the
self-driving
car
,
and
the
article
also
mentions
that
there
are
a
lot
of
legal
issues
with
the
opperation
of
anything
with
ai
brings
problems
of
responsibility
to
any
legal
procedings
there
would
have
to
be
development
of
a
national
law
,
or
every
state
would
have
to
come
up
with
their
own
laws
within
the
4
years
so
the
car
can
become
``
widely
adopted
.
''
if
no
national
law
is
made
,
then
each
state
would
most
likely
end
up
with
different
laws
being
made
,
and
would
make
owning
a
self-driving
car
on
a
road-trip
a
logistical
nightmare
,
anyone
who
travels
a
lot
would
run
into
many
issues
.
there
is
also
a
problem
in
that
none
of
the
officials
that
have
been
voted
for
in
recent
years
-lrb-
including
the
new
president
the
u.s.
will
have
in
2017
-rrb-
have
been
vocal
on
the
issue
,
which
leads
one
to
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
clear
consensus
in
making
the
laws
.
all
the
red
tape
stated
above
makes
the
2020
deadline
look
much
less
realistic
.
another
problem
that
has
to
be
thought
about
is
the
expense
of
the
car
.
as
the
article
only
references
two
makers
of
self-driving
and
semi-self-driving
cars
,
both
are
not
major
car
distributors
,
so
this
is
where
many
questions
pop
up
,
like
:
where
will
they
get
all
of
the
machines
to
start
mass
producing
the
cars
,
will
they
install
the
features
onto
other
cars
,
how
much
would
implementing
a
smart
system
on
an
old
car
cost
,
if
available
at
all
?
so
,
most
likely
,
the
only
people
who
would
own
a
self-driving
car
in
the
near
future
,
are
those
who
can
afford
to
buy
a
new
,
more
expensive
car
,
so
they
can
show
it
off
in
states
that
it
is
legal
to
drive
in
.
so
,
to
go
back
to
the
2020
timeline
,
that
seems
rediculous
.
give
it
until
2030
,
which
is
the
timeline
of
the
study
,
and
there
is
a
good
chance
that
self-driving
cars
are
around
in
small
quantities
.
