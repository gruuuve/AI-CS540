one
of
the
main
themes
in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
is
to
picture
what
effect
will
ai
have
in
a
typical
north
america
city
in
2030
.
the
authors
mainly
focused
on
eight
main
areas
such
as
transportation
,
healthcare
,
and
entertainment
.
although
some
of
the
points
in
the
paper
are
reasonable
,
there
are
two
points
in
the
paper
that
i
want
to
challenge
.
first
,
the
claim
that
self-driving
cars
may
eliminate
the
need
to
own
cars
.
second
,
the
imagination
of
the
home
robot
in
2030
.
let
us
first
look
at
the
authors
idea
that
self-driving
cars
and
peer-to-peer
transportation
services
may
eliminate
the
need
to
own
a
vehicle
on
page
21
.
i
agree
with
the
author
that
with
advanced
ai
systems
,
self-driving
cars
can
drive
better
than
humans
,
reduce
accident
rates
or
even
eliminate
traffic
accidents
,
and
therefore
the
time
for
a
people
to
get
from
point
a
to
point
b
will
be
reduced
and
can
be
precisely
predicted
.
i
also
agree
with
the
author
that
personal
rapid
transit
may
replace
the
current
public
transportation
system
since
ai
systems
,
with
the
help
of
cloud
computing
,
can
definitely
allocate
the
transportation
resource
to
specific
individuals
,
and
thus
allow
the
sort
of
one-person
public
transport
.
getting
from
point
a
to
point
b
is
important
for
people
who
owns
cars
today
,
however
,
that
may
not
be
the
only
reason
they
own
cars
.
for
example
,
when
on
a
road
trip
to
northern
michigan
,
families
may
suddenly
find
some
scenic
views
along
the
road
and
may
decide
to
stop
at
the
curb
to
take
photos
.
what
i
get
from
the
future
of
ai
with
transportation
from
the
paper
is
that
all
they
care
about
seems
to
get
people
from
point
a
to
point
b
,
without
considering
situations
like
i
mentioned
above
.
additionally
,
physical
sensation
pleasure
is
also
something
important
to
some
drivers
and
can
not
be
found
in
self-driving
cars
.
people
may
want
to
experience
the
fury
of
the
engine
,
feel
the
rage
of
the
car
,
and
enjoy
the
excitement
of
acceleration
when
driving
cars
.
however
,
with
self-driving
cars
,
all
i
can
see
is
cars
follow
the
instructions
from
the
ai
systems
strictly
to
ensure
safety
,
and
there
may
not
be
fun
in
driving
in
the
future
.
as
a
result
,
i
think
there
will
still
be
reasons
for
people
to
own
cars
.
another
point
i
want
to
challenge
is
the
idea
of
home
robots
in
2030
.
it
seems
from
the
description
on
page
25
that
in
2030
we
may
have
robots
that
are
capable
of
understanding
our
requests
and
that
requires
nlp
.
additionally
,
the
robots
can
finish
tasks
that
may
require
walking
,
computer
vision
,
and
the
ability
to
distinguish
and
identify
items
.
i
find
theses
robots
to
be
unrealistic
in
2030
,
first
of
all
,
different
homes
have
different
layouts
,
customs
,
and
requests
.
even
though
cloud
computing
may
enable
some
of
the
robots
to
do
daily
chores
in
a
lab
setup
,
it
may
be
challenging
to
develop
robots
that
will
work
in
all
homes
in
2030
.
personally
,
i
feel
home
robots
are
much
more
difficult
to
design
than
self-driving
cars
.
as
a
conclusion
,
although
ai
is
a
promising
field
,
and
may
enable
us
to
invent
self-driving
cars
,
but
it
may
not
substitute
the
need
to
own
cars
.
also
,
although
home
robots
may
be
available
in
the
future
,
it
may
be
challenging
to
have
them
ready
to
serve
us
in
2030
.
