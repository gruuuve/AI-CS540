the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
talks
about
the
vast
,
rapidly
growing
field
of
computing
that
is
artificial
intelligence
.
the
study
touches
on
the
fact
that
while
there
is
no
general
purpose
ai
,
there
are
eight
main
domains
for
which
ai
systems
are
specialized
to
complete
a
specific
set
of
tasks
.
some
of
these
blend
together
,
and
the
report
makes
a
claim
that
sometime
around
2030
there
will
be
physically
embodied
ai
applications
not
limited
to
cars
,
but
are
likely
to
include
trucks
,
flying
vehicles
,
and
personal
robots
.
i
,
however
,
do
not
believe
that
this
is
likely
to
be
true
,
and
can
be
contested
in
each
of
its
ai
domains
.
the
next
two
domains
,
service
robots
and
employment
and
workplace
,
overlap
each
other
a
fair
amount
.
the
claim
was
that
if
the
likelihood
of
self-driving
cars
takes
off
,
so
would
self-driving
trucks
and
flying
vehicles
.
these
options
would
be
most
useful
for
package
deliveries
and
other
kinds
of
shipments
.
the
issue
with
this
suggestion
lies
more
in
the
direction
of
employment
and
workplace
.
while
it
is
likely
that
most
people
would
be
content
with
smarter
,
faster
deliveries
,
they
most
likely
are
not
in
favor
of
it
when
it
replaces
their
job
,
which
was
being
that
person
that
made
deliveries
.
ai
and
robotics
have
already
outsourced
many
prior
human
jobs
,
and
even
though
jobs
are
created
within
the
process
,
those
jobs
are
harder
to
forecast
,
and
will
be
in
lesser
number
than
the
jobs
being
outsourced
.
for
this
reason
it
seems
unrealistic
for
unmanned
delivery
systems
to
develop
on
a
commercial
platform
.
the
final
domain
,
public
safety
and
security
,
proves
to
be
the
most
controversial
.
the
report
suggests
that
cars
can
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
but
to
what
extent
or
standard
will
this
claim
be
held
to
?
while
these
self-driving
cars
can
be
programmed
to
follow
basic
driving
rules
and
have
safe
driving
habits
,
there
will
inevitably
be
real-life
situations
that
simply
can
not
be
accounted
for
,
and
will
result
in
an
accident
.
the
report
even
touches
on
this
point
a
bit
.
the
legal
aspects
of
how
to
deal
with
an
incident
when
a
self-driving
vehicle
gets
into
an
accident
is
going
to
be
a
little
tricky
.
right
now
uber
is
testing
out
its
self-driving
cars
.
does
uber
take
full
responsibility
,
or
does
the
company
that
made
the
car
?
if
the
car
has
a
human
override
feature
,
is
the
human
still
only
at
fault
because
they
were
not
paying
attention
because
the
car
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
drive
itself
?
these
types
of
legalities
would
need
to
be
carefully
worked
out
,
but
could
very
well
keep
the
self-driving
car
out
of
the
commercial
market
.
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
is
a
very
unique
,
important
study
that
shows
a
lot
of
promise
within
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
.
as
was
stated
in
the
report
it
is
crucial
to
have
the
general
public
truly
understand
what
ai
is
about
,
and
that
it
is
hardly
a
cause
for
concern
that
ai
would
potentially
take
over
the
world
if
we
are
not
careful
.
however
,
some
of
the
reaches
that
the
report
envisions
for
ai
simply
will
not
come
to
full
fruition
.
there
are
many
technical
,
legal
,
and
societal
boundaries
to
clear
that
will
prove
too
difficult
for
mainstream
ai
.
