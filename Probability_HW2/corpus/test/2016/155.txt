the
one
hundred
years
study
on
artificial
intelligence
is
a
report
authored
by
a
handful
of
experts
in
the
field
and
published
by
stanford
university
press
.
the
report
is
essentially
a
brief
introduction
to
the
current
state
of
artificial
intelligence
and
a
forecast
of
the
technology
?
s
future
role
in
society
.
the
most
problematic
aspect
of
the
report
is
its
?
predictive
nature
causes
it
to
stumble
into
common
the
common
pitfalls
of
future
casting
.
first
,
the
papers
authors
have
a
vested
interest
in
seeing
the
rapid
growth
and
expansion
of
artificial
intelligence
.
they
are
mostly
researchers
in
the
field
of
ai
and
their
careers
depend
on
the
future
they
are
predicting
;
therefore
,
the
report
is
prone
to
be
overly
optimistic
.
furthermore
,
the
future
as
explained
in
the
report
is
an
extrapolation
of
current
work
being
done
by
the
authors
;
another
reason
the
study
may
be
too
optimistic
,
the
authors
are
predicting
a
bright
future
for
their
own
children
so
to
speak
.
second
,
as
experts
in
the
technology
sector
the
authors
should
know
better
than
most
how
the
future
of
technology
can
never
be
predicted
.
there
are
many
examples
of
the
inscrutability
of
tomorrows
technological
advances
.
such
as
bill
gates
underestimating
the
internet
till
1996
or
who
could
predict
in
the
year
2001
that
by
2016
the
world
technology
leaders
would
be
companies
called
amazon
,
google
and
facebook
.
likewise
,
if
one
were
to
predict
what
2016
would
be
like
from
a
technological
standpoint
fifteen
years
ago
they
would
look
to
the
tech-giants
of
the
the
early
2000s
such
as
ibm
or
america
online
but
has
it
can
be
seen
these
companies
would
not
have
led
to
correct
predictions
about
the
technological
state
of
2016
.
the
authors
of
the
one
hundred
years
study
on
artificial
intelligence
also
choose
to
follow
todays
tech-giants
to
predict
what
2030s
artificial
intelligence
may
look
like
.
the
report
frequently
cites
amazon
,
google
and
uber
to
predict
what
tomorrows
artificial
intelligence
may
look
like
.
while
the
reality
of
2030s
artificial
intelligence
may
be
largely
determined
by
a
university
of
california
student
who
will
drop
out
next
week
.
in
addition
to
being
fixated
on
today
?
s
tech-giants
the
authors
also
only
focus
on
current
american
technology
.
in
the
current
globalized
technological
climate
,
it
is
inherently
faulty
so
heavily
focus
on
one
geographical
or
economic
sphere
of
technological
development
while
synthesizing
artificial
intelligence
futures
.
although
the
study
is
focused
on
predicting
artificial
intelligences
impact
in
various
sectors
of
the
average
american
city
,
that
is
no
reason
to
exclude
foreign
companies
,
technology
,
or
expertise
from
the
calculus
of
what
artificial
intelligences
tomorrow
is
.
if
it
were
the
case
that
only
american
tech-companies
will
provide
american
businesses
with
the
new
technology
of
tomorrow
,
then
there
would
be
no
fault
in
the
authors
calculus
.
however
,
since
that
is
not
the
case
the
report
should
have
more
widely
considered
the
global
artificial
intelligence
market
as
a
whole
.
ultimately
this
report
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
current
state
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
usa
and
a
good
starting
place
for
learning
how
to
talk
about
ai
but
when
looking
to
the
future
certainty
can
not
be
achieved
.
