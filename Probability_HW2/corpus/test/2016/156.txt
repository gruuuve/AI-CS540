in
stanford
's
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
entitled
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
''
one
of
the
main
domains
of
focus
is
in
ai
is
on
education
.
one
of
the
main
focuses
of
the
section
on
education
is
online
learning
and
the
potential
of
massive
open
online
courses
,
also
known
as
moocs
,
as
a
future
form
of
education
for
the
masses
.
while
moocs
supply
great
learning
material
and
the
ability
for
instructors
to
test
the
knowledge
of
thousands
of
students
,
i
do
not
believe
that
moocs
will
ever
have
the
capability
to
replace
the
traditional
educational
setting
of
the
classroom
.
extremely
popular
moocs
such
as
edx
and
udacity
offer
courses
taught
at
top
universities
such
as
mit
and
harvard
,
and
also
offer
assignments
similar
to
the
assignments
that
students
of
the
universities
are
given
.
what
differed
between
edx
and
mit
in
the
past
is
that
one
offered
only
knowledge
while
the
other
offered
credits
towards
a
diploma
.
edx
has
begun
offering
new
programs
called
micromasters
and
xseries
which
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
not
offering
a
reward
for
learning
.
the
micromasters
program
claims
to
be
credit-eligible
and
supposedly
recognized
by
companies
,
and
the
xseries
program
offers
a
certificate
that
can
act
as
a
resume
booster
.
even
with
these
new
incentives
,
dropout
rates
for
moocs
are
extremely
high
.
popular
figures
suggest
on
average
a
90
percent
-lrb-
pope
-rrb-
drop
out
rate
by
mooc
participants
.
i
believe
that
this
high
drop
out
rate
is
due
not
only
to
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
certificates
and
credits
offered
,
but
also
because
of
a
lack
of
face
to
face
contact
,
resulting
in
a
lower
level
of
responsibility
and
less
structure
.
what
i
believe
makes
traditional
education
so
successful
is
the
classroom
environment
and
having
a
structured
zone
for
learning
.
what
moocs
claim
is
one
of
their
strengths
-
portability
-
i
argue
is
actually
a
weakness
.
all
students
read
and
gain
some
knowledge
outside
of
the
classroom
in
the
form
of
a
textbook
and
notes
,
but
it
is
the
classroom
setting
where
much
of
that
knowledge
is
grounded
and
set
into
place
.
attempting
to
take
an
online
class
for
school
is
difficult
because
there
is
no
central
place
to
solidify
your
knowledge
,
and
moocs
are
even
more
challenging
because
there
is
often
not
a
large
incentive
besides
extra
knowledge
.
i
believe
that
although
moocs
will
never
take
the
place
of
traditional
education
,
they
will
eventually
act
as
supplementary
material
in
most
educational
settings
.
universities
must
learn
to
take
advantage
of
some
of
the
features
of
moocs
like
online
lectures
and
ai-based
homework
grading
.
having
additional
lectures
and
content
online
can
enrich
the
learning
process
outside
of
the
classroom
,
and
online
quizzes
and
homework
that
can
be
graded
by
ai
programs
could
allow
for
professors
to
focus
even
more
on
their
curriculum
and
helping
their
students
learn
even
more
.
while
moocs
offer
many
great
benefits
to
thousands
of
people
,
the
idea
presented
by
the
stanford
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
of
moocs
being
at
the
center
of
education
seems
extremely
unlikely
.
i
believe
that
moocs
will
never
be
able
to
gain
the
confidence
of
employers
and
students
like
universities
are
capable
of
.
moocs
still
offer
great
value
to
professionals
looking
to
gain
new
skills
,
but
i
believe
that
at
most
moocs
will
only
ever
serve
to
enhance
the
classic
educational
approach
,
not
replace
it
.
