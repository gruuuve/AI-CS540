overview
this
essay
is
aimed
at
challenging
one
or
more
aspects
of
``
stanford
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
.
one
of
the
section
of
this
study
,
``
public
safety
and
security
''
makes
really
powerful
and
big
assumptions
for
estimating
the
future
of
ai
in
north
american
cities
.
the
challenge
the
study
suggests
that
by
2030
a
typical
north
american
city
will
rely
heavily
on
ai
technologies
for
public
safety
and
security
.
here
is
a
pointwise
challenge
on
some
of
the
major
aspects
.

.
cameras
,
drones
and
other
ai
based
monitoring
tools
:
tools
like
cameras
for
surveillance
,
drones
and
predictive
policing
will
make
a
big
impact
in
social
security
.
through
the
usage
of
such
tools
the
law
and
order
enforcement
organizations
can
get
a
lot
of
assistance
,
but
always
relying
on
this
assistance
is
not
a
good
idea
.
under
adverse
weather
conditions
like
cyclones
,
hurricanes
,
floods
etc
these
advanced
equipments
-lrb-
drones
,
cameras
-rrb-
may
become
dysfunctional
.
absence
of
all
weather
tools
like
human
resources
in
such
cases
can
potentially
worsen
the
situation
and
be
catastrophic
.

.
predictive
policing
and
reducing
human
bias
:
human
intelligence
has
evolved
to
the
current
levels
because
of
the
experiences
and
research
accumulated
over
more
than
a
million
of
years
.
for
predictive
policing
to
overpower
human
judgement
based
policing
,
can
take
a
lot
of
time
than
what
is
stated
in
the
report
.
the
study
speculates
that
concerns
like
ai
policing
becoming
pervasive
or
overbearing
might
be
overcome
using
well
deployed
ai
tools
.
it
goes
on
to
assume
that
such
tools
may
have
the
potential
to
actually
reduce
or
remove
human
decision
making
bias
.
this
can
also
take
a
lot
of
time
as
the
ai
community
has
to
first
create
well
tested
decision
making
tools
,
implement
it
in
small
parts
of
the
country
,
verify
the
results
and
then
roll
out
on
a
large
scale
.
a
lot
of
iterations
generally
happen
in
such
complex
software
development
as
expectations
do
n't
meet
reality
.

helping
tackle
crime
:
improvements
in
machine
learning
and
ai
will
make
a
big
impact
in
detecting
white
collar
crime
such
as
credit
card
fraud
and
also
in
helping
police
manage
crime
scenes
or
rescue
events
by
providing
tools
which
do
not
exist
yet
.
the
reluctance
of
various
organizations
to
invest
in
research
and
development
of
such
tools
may
come
into
account
as
there
is
no
clarity
on
the
usability
of
such
tools
.
adding
human
intuition
for
making
split
second
decisions
may
be
more
complicated
than
estimated
.

scanning
twitter
and
other
newsfeed
to
detect
events
that
affect
national
security
may
help
in
preventing
people
being
radicalized
by
isis
or
other
violent
groups
but
can
lead
to
government
erroneously
spamming
leisure
users
.
handling
privacy
concerns
and
providing
security
at
the
same
time
may
pose
a
big
challenge
to
such
efforts
.

.
security
and
other
law
agencies
increased
reliance
on
ai
:
reliance
on
ai
based
tools
for
interrogation
,
interviewing
and
detecting
possible
deceptions
might
decrease
the
overall
efficiency
.
tsa
officers
who
are
appointed
after
rigorous
training
will
have
to
make
an
additional
judgement
about
the
perceived
decision
of
an
ai
system
in
a
tricky
situation
.
a
single
mistake
in
such
cases
can
pose
threat
to
national
security
and
will
shatter
the
trust
of
many
in
ai
.
conclusion
for
artificial
intelligence
to
become
as
reliant
and
efficient
as
human
intelligence
particularly
in
the
field
of
``
public
safety
and
security
''
will
take
a
longer
time
than
what
is
expected
by
the
stanford
study
on
future
of
ai
.
