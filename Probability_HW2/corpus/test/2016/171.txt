whenever
a
new
invent
comes
out
,
people
will
always
question
about
its
utility
and
efficiency
.
ai
has
been
debated
for
such
a
long
time
,
and
there
is
no
conclusion
on
how
good
or
how
bad
ai
is
.
as
a
new
learner
,
i
am
optimistic
about
ai
and
expect
it
to
solve
more
obstacles
we
are
currently
faced
.
however
,
after
reading
this
paper
,
i
want
to
challenge
it
on
two
aspects
.
one
is
related
to
the
efficiency
in
the
medical
field
,
and
the
other
is
about
the
utility
of
self-driving
cars
.
in
the
medical
field
,
ai
would
not
be
efficient
because
it
is
necessary
to
check
time
after
time
to
make
sure
the
machine
is
actually
learning
and
makes
a
relatively
high
precision
of
disease
detection
.
also
,
collecting
enough
data
for
machine
learning
is
both
time-consuming
and
expensive
.
collecting
data
and
finding
out
the
particularity
of
the
damaged
brains
take
an
incredible
amount
of
time
and
money
.
the
first
step
of
conducting
research
is
collecting
data
.
the
hospitals
need
to
pay
people
who
get
involved
in
taking
some
scans
from
their
brains
.
using
the
scanners
is
expensive
since
the
machine
to
make
high-resolution
images
is
gigantic
and
electricity-consuming
.
before
we
get
to
the
machine
learning
part
,
we
should
have
scans
from
at
least
100
subjects
to
make
the
data
analysis
as
precise
as
possible
.
then
,
following
the
concrete
pipelines
of
image
processing
,
we
get
the
data
including
multi-variables
and
start
to
do
the
parcellation
.
however
,
there
is
no
universally
good
classifier
to
tell
whether
people
have
the
disease
or
not
.
even
the
purpose
of
the
study
is
related
,
the
area
in
the
brain
associated
with
the
goal
may
vary
for
different
people
.
for
example
,
people
may
suffer
from
aphasia
after
the
stroke
,
so
their
damaged
area
in
the
brain
would
be
distinct
from
those
patients
without
aphasia
.
all
in
all
,
there
are
so
many
things
people
should
do
to
make
machine
learning
methodologies
useful
.
managing
the
massive
database
and
generating
the
proper
classifier
are
not
so
simple
to
achieve
.
so
,
i
am
worried
about
whether
ai
is
more
efficiently
on
helping
people
detect
disease
than
a
doctor
.
except
for
the
application
of
machine
learning
in
the
medical
field
,
the
existence
of
ai
may
not
be
necessary
for
some
other
areas
.
some
paragraphs
talking
about
self-driving
cars
arouse
my
attention
.
even
though
the
self-driving
car
is
possible
to
develop
in
the
future
,
it
is
not
practical
to
use
in
real
life
.
people
can
make
a
judgment
on
unexpected
issues
.
for
example
,
if
a
driver
notices
an
individual
who
intends
to
cross
the
road
,
he
or
she
will
slow
down
and
make
a
gesture
to
let
the
pedestrian
go
first
.
will
the
machine
understand
people
`
s
intention
to
cross
the
street
without
seeing
pedestrian
crossing
lines
?
another
common
thing
is
that
there
will
be
some
police
officers
to
maintain
the
traffic
order
in
the
road
construction
area
.
i
am
not
entirely
confident
that
the
self-driving
car
will
follow
the
guidance
with
simple
gestures
those
people
made
.
in
other
words
,
the
limitation
of
ai
is
that
it
has
built-in
programs
,
and
they
just
follow
the
instructions
again
and
again
.
in
real
life
,
the
world
keeps
changing
and
the
program
has
been
constructed
in
yesterday
may
not
be
suitable
for
the
following
day
.
and
that
is
why
i
doubt
the
usefulness
and
efficiency
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
disease
detection
and
self
-
driving
a
car
.
