``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
aims
to
answer
many
questions
and
concerns
regarding
ai
and
its
advancements
and
utilizations
within
the
next
15
years
.
the
report
focuses
on
eight
major
fields
which
include
transportation
,
service
robots
,
healthcare
,
education
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
and
security
,
employment
in
the
workplace
,
and
entertainment
.
the
focus
on
these
fields
is
mainly
surrounding
where
ai
could
be
within
the
coming
15
years
and
does
consider
potential
setbacks
to
the
advancement
of
ai
in
our
everyday
lives
.
even
with
the
amount
of
information
provided
to
support
the
idea
of
these
advancements
occurring
in
our
society
,
the
report
misses
something
due
to
assumptions
made
.
the
two
major
assumptions
that
stood
out
were
the
willingness
of
society
to
adopt
and
purchase
artificial
intelligence
and
the
assumption
that
we
will
find
answers
to
the
questions
that
are
stated
throughout
the
article
within
the
next
15
years
.
it
is
these
two
pieces
of
the
article
that
will
be
briefly
addressed
and
challenged
to
show
that
,
although
ai
is
a
growing
field
,
many
things
still
need
to
be
considered
before
moving
forward
with
more
technological
advancements
.
for
ai
to
be
able
to
move
forward
,
the
technology
must
be
well
understood
and
accepted
throughout
our
society
.
unfortunately
,
the
article
makes
assumptions
that
individuals
will
be
willing
to
part
ways
with
the
old
and
move
to
the
new
.
in
the
best
case
scenario
,
yes
,
this
may
occur
,
but
for
an
entire
country
to
openly
accept
a
new
commodity
within
15
years
is
an
unreasonable
assumption
.
an
example
of
this
from
the
article
like
this
is
as
follows
.
``
as
cars
will
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
city-dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
,
live
further
from
work
,
and
spend
time
differently
,
leading
to
an
entirely
new
urban
organization
.
''
this
quote
assumes
that
individuals
in
urban
environments
will
openly
accept
the
new
technology
and
do
away
with
the
old
when
regarding
transportation
.
unfortunately
,
even
if
large
masses
of
the
urban
population
buy
into
this
,
there
will
still
be
individuals
who
want
to
stick
with
what
they
know
or
individuals
who
simply
can
not
afford
to
move
forward
with
the
advancements
in
technology
,
another
short-falling
of
the
report
.
assuming
that
entire
populations
will
openly
accept
ai
and
willingly
purchase
something
that
is
still
in
its
early
stages
of
life
with
many
unanswered
questions
about
is
an
unsafe
assumption
at
best
.
this
transitions
to
the
second
portion
of
why
there
are
issues
with
the
report
,
and
this
is
the
amount
of
questions
left
unanswered
.
the
report
is
quite
thorough
with
explaining
who
,
what
,
where
,
and
why
,
but
it
still
leaves
the
reader
questioning
many
aspects
of
ai
and
the
complexities
surrounding
it
.
many
of
these
unanswered
questions
revolve
around
questions
that
will
take
time
to
understand
and
solve
,
much
longer
than
the
15-year
window
that
is
considered
in
the
report
.
so
even
though
the
ambitious
nature
of
the
report
is
admirable
,
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
society
as
a
whole
to
move
to
this
new
technology
so
willingly
,
especially
after
being
tainted
with
ideas
of
ai
by
the
entertainment
industry
.
in
conclusion
,
this
report
does
bring
up
many
aspects
of
ai
and
how
it
will
affect
society
as
it
progresses
in
the
coming
future
.
unfortunately
,
the
assumptions
made
and
the
questions
left
unanswered
will
prove
to
be
larger
obstacles
in
the
progression
of
ai
than
what
appears
to
be
considered
in
the
report
and
what
is
promised
regarding
potential
advancements
in
technology
.
these
advancements
may
be
reached
at
some
point
in
the
future
,
but
the
15
year
wait
may
be
an
optimistic
view
on
what
is
to
come
.
