in
today
's
society
,
artificial
intelligence
has
become
a
part
of
everyday
life
.
it
has
become
a
natural
part
of
daily
life
,
and
has
reduced
human
ability
to
some
extent
.
for
example
,
the
one
hundred
year
study
recognizes
calculators
as
having
already
reduced
a
child
's
ability
to
perform
basic
arithmetic
operations
.
as
artificial
intelligence
is
implemented
more
and
more
into
our
lives
,
it
is
important
to
continue
to
challenge
the
value
of
its
implementations
to
society
.
although
outdated
,
a
quote
from
jurassic
park
fits
well
in
focusing
on
the
ethical
points
of
ai
:
``
you
're
scientists
were
so
preoccupied
with
whether
of
not
they
could
,
they
did
n't
stop
to
think
if
they
should
''
.
though
the
context
that
the
quote
applies
to
is
trivial
,
the
meaning
behind
it
is
not
.
one
issue
that
comes
to
mind
when
thinking
of
the
ethics
of
ai
is
the
idea
of
democracy
and
freedom
of
speech
and
thought
.
would
a
machine
that
is
able
to
learn
the
beliefs
and
views
of
human
society
and
culture
be
able
to
change
them
as
well
?
for
example
,
the
use
of
ai
to
run
campaigns
for
political
offices
could
be
able
to
persuade
voters
in
a
way
that
the
human
campaign
runners
could
not
.
skewing
a
vote
in
this
way
could
result
in
misrepresentation
that
democracy
is
built
to
withold
.
another
issue
that
arises
when
talking
about
the
ethics
of
ai
is
how
these
machines
will
replace
humans
in
job
markets
.
factories
across
the
world
have
been
revolutionized
by
robots
performing
the
work
that
humans
once
did
.
machines
in
these
roles
will
require
a
new
set
of
skills
from
humans
to
maintain
them
-lrb-
creating
new
jobs
-rrb-
,
but
overall
much
of
the
manufacturing
and
processing
jobs
will
be
streamlined
by
robots
and
machines
.
this
in
turn
will
have
an
effect
on
the
economy
that
will
need
to
be
addressed
.
finally
,
the
psychological
effects
on
people
when
responding
to
ai
and
its
applications
and
services
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
.
as
almost
every
aspect
of
the
world
is
being
touched
or
changed
by
ai
,
people
will
have
different
responses
to
these
advances
.
the
growth
and
development
of
societies
will
rely
on
ai
,
and
each
society
will
handle
it
differently
.
