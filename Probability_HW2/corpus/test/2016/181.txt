one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
discusses
the
now
and
the
future
of
ai
from
both
technical
and
societal
viewpoints
.
among
many
topics
argued
,
i
challenge
their
insight
about
how
ai
will
affect
the
people
in
the
future
.
specifically
,
the
study
panel
asserts
that
people
,
especially
the
future
children
,
will
get
used
to
interacting
with
ai
,
leading
them
to
perceive
ai
a
completely
ordinary
part
of
lives
.
however
,
because
of
the
consistent
,
subtle
gaps
that
will
inevitably
exist
between
humans
and
artificial
intelligence
,
i
have
pessimistic
views
on
the
claim
that
people
in
the
future
will
naturally
adapt
to
interaction
with
ai
.
what
makes
human
human
?
our
humanness
originates
from
the
complex
psychological
process
that
occurs
in
the
brain
.
whether
an
artificial
intelligence
bears
humanness
may
be
tested
by
the
turing
test
and
an
equivalence
to
a
human
brain
should
be
crucial
to
passing
.
some
suggest
supercomputers
with
the
performance
of
more
than
10
^
15
flops
already
mimic
our
brain
performance
.
i
agree
with
their
comparison
of
the
hardware
part
of
ai
with
human
brains
,
but
i
believe
the
current
ai
still
lacks
the
software
part
which
is
the
internal
communications
between
neurons
and
synapses
.
on
the
other
hand
,
there
exist
examples
of
artificial
intelligence
that
understands
and
expresses
human
emotion
.
those
ais
have
even
shown
their
possibility
of
interacting
with
people
.
pepper
,
for
instance
,
a
humanoid
developed
by
softbank
,
interprets
human
emotions
by
adopting
ibm
s
ai
,
watson
.
when
softbank
started
an
app
competition
for
pepper
,
the
first
prize
went
to
an
app
called
hug
.
hug
equips
a
pepper
with
a
3d
camera
that
records
an
event
so
that
the
person
at
the
remote
place
with
oculus
rift
and
pepper
can
experience
the
event
.
hug
developer
,
norikazu
takagi
,
used
it
for
his
great-grandmother
who
could
not
attend
his
wedding
because
she
was
unable
to
move
out
from
her
bed
.
however
,
thanks
to
hug
,
his
great-grandmother
watched
takagi
s
wedding
,
virtually
hugged
him
,
300km
away
from
the
wedding
,
by
actually
hugging
pepper
.
after
all
these
,
she
eventually
cried
to
the
joy
of
being
the
part
of
her
great-grandson
s
wedding
.

takagi
and
his
great-grandmother
were
able
to
be
immersed
in
that
bizarre
robot-hugging
situation
because
pepper
actually
showed
emotions
.
pepper
s
case
may
be
the
evidence
that
interaction
between
humans
and
ais
are
possible
.
however
,
it
was
not
pepper
itself
which
led
takagi
s
great-grandmother
to
tears
,
but
the
actual
human
interactions
.
pepper
was
merely
the
means
that
assisted
the
connection
between
two
individuals
who
were
far
away
from
each
other
.
moreover
,
the
single
ability
to
imitate
human
emotions
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
pepper
had
the
perfect
humanness
.
humans
have
far
more
human
abilities
like
dealing
with
complex
relationship
problems
,
telling
white
lies
,
etc.
.
unless
the
software
of
artificial
intelligence
perfectly
mimics
the
way
our
brain
works
,
humans
will
prefer
real
humans
over
fake
ones
that
solely
manipulate
the
data
input
by
ai
developers
.
that
ai
is
developed
by
humans
also
steers
us
to
the
realization
that
its
reaction
will
be
limited
only
to
raw
and
altered
repertoires
input
by
the
development
team
and
ai
s
learning
itself
.
in
summary
,
i
think
differently
on
the
report
s
outlook
on
probability
of
people
getting
accustomed
to
interacting
with
ais
due
to
ai
s
lack
of
humanness
.
even
though
few
features
of
humanness
may
deceive
us
to
the
conclusion
that
ai
can
fully
communicate
with
humans
,
they
are
just
short-sighted
understandings
that
have
not
considered
the
intricacy
of
how
human
brains
work
.
however
,
i
am
optimistic
that
ais
will
help
facilitate
interactions
between
humans
in
quite
a
lot
of
conditions
.
