the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
largely
focuses
on
the
predicted
future
of
artificial
intelligence
become
integrated
into
everyday
human
life
.
the
study
mentions
that
the
first
,
future
appearance
of
widespread
artificial
intelligence
integration
is
predicted
to
be
self-driving
cars
.
though
this
is
a
reasonable
,
and
needed
,
first
step
into
allowing
computerized
systems
to
make
our
lives
easier
and
better
by
removing
the
dangers
and
inconvenience
of
driving
ourselves
,
i
believe
that
self-driving
cars
will
not
be
the
first
arrival
of
a
widespread
artificial
intelligence
in
the
future
.
my
belief
is
that
,
instead
of
self-driving
cars
,
artificial
intelligence
will
first
be
used
popularize
ai-controlled
drones
and
possibly
automated
,
ai-controlled
trains
.
the
reasons
i
believe
that
ai-controlled
drones
and
trains
will
come
before
self-driving
cars
is
that
drones
are
not
involved
directly
in
human
transport
and
would
not
pose
an
immediate
threat
to
humans
if
they
were
to
malfunction
;
this
will
allow
people
who
may
question
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
in
everyday
use
to
become
more
accustomed
with
and
accept
ai-controlled
machines
and
devices
.
human-controlled
drones
and
artificial
intelligence-controlled
drones
are
both
used
recreationally
and
are
beginning
to
be
used
commercially
.
currently
,
drones
are
used
by
some
companies
to
deliver
packages
or
mail
to
people
.
many
drones
are
also
used
for
their
video
capabilities
:
drones
can
easily
fly
in
and
around
hard
to
reach
areas
to
capture
footage
for
use
by
the
military
,
news
,
documentaries
,
etc.
.
one
such
company
,
amazon
prime
air
,
is
a
future
delivery
system
that
will
rely
exclusively
on
unmanned
drones
to
deliver
services
to
millions
of
customers
.
this
may
be
the
first
step
towards
widespread
,
common
usage
of
ai-controlled
technologies
in
modern
society
.
one
of
the
obstacles
that
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
states
is
slowing
down
the
advancement
of
artificial
intelligence
is
the
common
fear
of
artificial
intelligence
being
too
dangerous
for
everyday
use
.
automatic
ai-controlled
trains
may
also
be
one
of
the
first
widespread
ai-controlled
technologies
used
in
the
future
because
,
even
though
trains
typically
carry
more
passengers
than
cars
,
trains
have
to
follow
designated
paths
to
their
destinations
-lrb-
rails
or
tracks
-rrb-
.
this
means
that
the
trains
will
be
limited
to
certain
areas
and
will
not
be
as
widespread
as
cars
,
which
may
allow
people
to
accept
fully
automated
trains
before
they
accept
fully
automated
cars
.
the
fact
that
ai-controlled
trains
would
still
be
limited
to
the
rails
or
tracks
would
also
make
it
easier
to
program
and
create
the
artificial
intelligence
to
manage
the
train
and
its
pathing
.
