stanford
s
analysis
of
how
artificial
intelligence
has
progressed
over
the
past
hundred
was
very
thorough
and
enlightening
.
this
analysis
covered
many
different
facets
of
ai
,
such
as
healthcare
,
education
,
and
even
public
security
.
with
the
picture
that
was
painted
by
the
authors
,
one
would
think
that
with
ai
s
rapid
advancement
,
society
will
soon
reach
a
golden
age
where
artificial
intelligence
will
do
the
mundane
jobs
that
humans
are
currently
tasked
with
!
however
,
the
way
that
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
presents
transportation
advancement
is
overly
optimistic
by
assuming
that
the
public
s
perception
will
be
influenced
strongly
enough
that
humans
will
forego
the
desire
to
drive
on
the
open
road
as
well
as
the
fears
that
are
had
with
self-driving
vehicles
.
in
the
study
,
the
authors
go
into
great
detail
about
the
challenges
that
have
been
overcome
in
regards
to
autonomous
transportation
.
some
examples
of
this
include
the
recent
near-standardization
of
gps
in
cars
,
automatic
lane
changing
and
parallel
parking
,
and
even
blind
spot
monitoring
.
the
authors
even
go
so
far
as
to
tell
the
reader
that
,
a
recent
report
predicts
self-driving
cars
to
be
widely
adopted
by
2020
,
which
gives
the
notion
that
many
people
will
give
up
their
current
vehicles
for
self-driving
ones
.
one
aspect
that
the
study
does
not
touch
in
regards
to
transportation
advancement
,
however
,
is
that
there
will
be
people
that
will
not
want
to
give
up
their
dumb
vehicles
simply
due
to
recreational
reasons
,
whether
that
be
for
sport
or
to
just
drive
around
town
.
along
with
that
,
having
a
vehicle
that
is
much
more
complex
and
specialized
than
older
and
current
vehicles
-lrb-
e.g.
various
sensor\/computing
systems
-rrb-
makes
it
more
difficult
for
hobbyists
to
work
on
and
maintain
their
car
.
this
also
translates
to
repairs
and
maintenance
rising
in
cost
for
those
that
have
to
take
their
vehicle
to
the
repair
shop
.
another
aspect
that
the
study
does
not
delve
too
deeply
into
is
the
security
of
these
vehicles
.
while
the
authors
do
mention
that
security
and
hacking
could
be
a
problem
,
the
notion
is
essentially
shrugged
off
with
the
thought
that
someone
will
eventually
take
care
of
it
,
therefore
is
it
a
nonissue
.
while
this
is
something
that
one
would
hope
is
true
,
it
is
already
proving
to
be
very
false
.
about
one
year
ago
,
two
hackers
proved
to
a
journalist
that
they
could
gain
unauthorized
access
to
the
journalist
s
jeep
s
digital
systems
,
effectively
letting
them
take
control
of
the
car
.
when
the
hackers
presented
their
findings
,
chrysler
was
pretty
much
silent
in
hopes
that
the
hack
would
not
get
released
.
this
year
,
the
same
hackers
presented
even
more
attacks
on
the
same
vehicle
at
the
black
hat
security
conference
.
with
the
introduction
of
more
and
more
autonomous
vehicles
and
the
corporate
notoriety
of
cutting
costs
,
one
could
easily
see
how
these
attacks
could
grow
in
numbers
as
the
vehicles
become
more
and
more
prevalent
.
these
types
of
attacks
could
very
easily
jeopardize
the
lives
of
the
everyday
citizen
.
even
though
the
authors
did
not
talk
about
these
issues
,
these
problems
could
essentially
be
eliminated
if
the
time
and
effort
is
put
into
developing
secure
and
robust
operating
systems
for
autonomous
systems
.
