i
would
like
to
challenge
the
article
's
view
on
ai
's
impacts
on
jobs
:
in
general
,
the
article
admits
the
development
of
ai
will
have
a
profound
impact
on
employment
and
manpower
.
yet
,
it
claims
that
it
is
still
unsure
whether
the
impact
will
be
positive
or
negative
.
its
main
viewpoints
are
as
the
followings
:
\*
ai
will
affect
employment
in
a
wider
range
,
including
labor
,
skill
middle
and
even
high
end
of
professional
services
.
but
before
we
know
what
the
changes
are
,
we
can
not
tell
its
impact
to
the
labor
and
skill
demands
.
\*
to
help
overcome
the
understandable
human
fear
of
being
marginalized
,
ai
should
be
innovated
in
a
way
that
it
replaces
tasks
instead
of
jobs
in
the
short
term
.
\*
ai
can
create
new
jobs
.
but
we
can
not
tell
what
exact
jobs
it
will
create
at
this
moment
.
\*
people
will
lose
jobs
:
``
a
majority
of
citizens
may
find
the
value
of
their
labor
insufficient
to
pay
for
a
socially
acceptable
standard
of
living
.
''
to
solve
this
problem
,
we
need
political
responses
on
top
of
economic
solutions
.
\*
in
the
short
run
,
education
,
re-training
,
and
inventing
new
goods
and
services
may
mitigate
these
effects
.
in
the
long
run
,
we
need
to
reconsider
social
security
and
how
to
distribute
the
economic
benefits
brought
by
ai-technologies
.
from
my
perspective
,
ai
certainly
will
have
a
negative
impact
to
employment
,
at
least
in
the
short
run
.
we
should
not
deny
this
.
instead
,
we
should
emphasize
on
aligning
social
policies
with
technology
innovations
.
firstly
,
economic
behavior
is
driven
by
market
supply
and
demand
.
if
new
technologies
emerge
that
can
remarkably
reduce
manufacturing
or
service
costs
,
companies
will
just
pursue
it
.
we
can
not
rely
on
innovation
process
itself
steering
towards
``
replacing
tasks
instead
of
jobs
in
the
short
term
''
.
regulation
seems
a
must
.
secondly
,
the
jobs
created
by
ai-technologies
have
no
chance
to
make
up
for
the
jobs
it
replaces
.
on
one
hand
,
again
,
innovation
is
market
driven
.
if
the
result
of
applying
one
technology
is
to
hire
more
people
in
the
long
run
,
that
technology
is
dead
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
jobs
ai
brings
are
n't
of
the
same
requirements
as
the
jobs
it
takes
away
.
you
ca
n't
ask
a
mid-aged
farmer
,
who
barely
understands
how
computer
works
,
to
learn
,
say
,
database
management
overnight
.
the
skill
gap
is
real
and
the
transform
through
education
and
re-training
may
just
not
work
.
it
's
likely
that
ai
will
essentially
destroy
the
jobs
of
this
generation
and
create
a
bunch
of
replacements
for
the
next
.
