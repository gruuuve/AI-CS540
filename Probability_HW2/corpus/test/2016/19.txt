artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
is
changing
the
way
society
interacts
with
computers
,
people
,
and
objects
.
though
still
requiring
human
interaction
and
input
,
ai
is
slowly
becoming
increasingly
prevalent
in
the
education
sector
in
the
united
states
.
since
the
1980s
,
schools
have
been
implementing
ai
technologies
such
as
lego
mindstorms
and
more
recently
massive
open
online
courses
-lrb-
moocs
-rrb-
such
as
udacity
and
coursera
.
stanford
's
100-year
study
on
ai
advocates
for
online
learning
and
its
dispersion
into
countries
that
may
have
limited
resources
dedicated
to
education
.
however
,
ai
's
implementation
in
education
has
potential
negative
implications
on
global
societies
.
the
2016
report
emphasizes
that
moocs
will
make
it
easier
to
create
a
foundation
for
international
educational
programs
with
little
to
no
training
.
what
is
not
acknowledged
are
the
cultural
and
socioeconomic
implications
associated
with
the
globalization
of
education
.
the
abdication
of
some
of
the
ancient
cultures
is
due
to
the
technological
movement
through
globalization
;
and
ai
is
no
different
.
countries
that
are
not
fully
developed
have
their
own
methods
of
teaching
that
are
rooted
deep
within
their
cultures
.
for
example
,
some
indian
schools
teach
sanskrit
and
other
ancient
languages
verbally
that
can
not
be
taught
through
a
computer
.
likewise
,
in
most
cases
with
teaching
a
language
,
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
account
for
all
the
colloquialisms
and
idioms
that
are
associated
with
that
language
.
they
evolve
constantly
and
would
require
significant
storage
and
constant
updating
.
furthermore
,
though
natural
language
processing
-lrb-
nlp
-rrb-
has
made
significant
strides
in
artificializing
language
education
,
it
can
not
verbalize
the
proper
enunciations
with
most
languages
,
limiting
its
global
usefulness
and
scope
.
in
addition
,
countries
that
are
not
fully
developed
do
not
always
have
access
to
resources
for
online
learning
throughout
the
country
.
these
resources
vary
from
funding
and
people
to
an
internet
connection
.
though
facebook
and
apple
are
promoting
global
wi-fi
,
the
success
of
online
learning
is
based
on
the
availability
of
wi-fi
or
a
consistent
internet
connection
.
therefore
,
with
variable
and
inconsistent
connections
,
it
is
not
practical
to
globalize
ai
in
education
.
in
addition
,
some
schools
in
the
united
states
can
not
afford
ai
in
their
schools
;
consequently
,
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
a
full
globalization
of
ai
in
education
since
under-developed
countries
have
to
allocate
monetary
resources
throughout
all
sectors
,
not
just
education
.
lastly
,
though
artificial
intelligence
can
assist
teachers
,
they
limit
the
interaction
between
the
teacher
and
the
student
.
these
online
learning
machines
can
not
provide
students
with
human
touch
and
the
feeling
of
a
togetherness
and
emotional
understanding
,
that
comes
with
human
to
human
interaction
.
in
addition
,
ai
machines
lack
the
ability
to
sympathize
and
empathize
with
student
's
situations
,
thereby
not
providing
emotional\/mental
support
unlike
that
with
humans
.
in
indian
culture
,
it
is
quite
common
for
students
to
form
lifetime
bonds
with
their
professors
,
a
longtime
tradition
that
may
be
eradicated
with
the
wide-net
introduction
of
ai
.
the
stanford
report
notes
that
ai
is
not
meant
to
fully
eliminate
teachers
,
but
rather
assist
them
;
though
true
,
it
strains
the
relationship
between
teacher
and
student
by
adding
additional
complexity
with
another
variable
.
stanford
's
100-year
report
presents
valid
points
to
the
benefits
of
artificial
intelligence
;
however
,
it
does
not
accurately
classify
the
globalization
of
ai
in
the
education
sector
,
primary
in
third
world
developing
countries
.
what
it
does
not
account
for
are
the
social
and
cultural
implications
introduced
by
changing
the
culture
with
ai
.
