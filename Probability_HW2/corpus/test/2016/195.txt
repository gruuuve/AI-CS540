artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
has
ushered
in
an
age
of
extremely
advanced
technology
that
people
could
only
dream
of
a
few
decades
ago
.
with
benefits
in
areas
ranging
from
human-machine
interaction
to
entertainment
services
,
ai
appears
to
be
just
as
incredible
and
helpful
as
everyone
had
hoped
.
however
,
the
benefits
of
ai
necessarily
precipitate
more
challenges
and
issues
.
one
significant
area
in
which
ai
has
brought
many
benefits
as
well
as
issues
is
in
the
realm
of
public
safety
and
security
.
in
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
presented
by
stanford
university
,
the
authors
note
how
ai
in
the
realm
of
security
allows
for
increased
protection
from
criminals
and
terrorists
while
only
vaguely
referencing
how
people
will
react
to
the
increased
autonomous
surveillance
.
it
seems
much
more
likely
that
,
in
the
presence
of
powerful
and
widespread
ais
capable
of
searching
through
personal
data
,
monitoring
all
areas
at
all
times
,
etc.
,
human
beings
will
have
a
much
larger
reaction
to
what
they
will
almost
certainly
perceive
as
an
infringement
on
privacy
.
the
one
hundred
year
study
article
-lrb-
henceforth
referenced
as
simply
``
the
study
''
-rrb-
presents
several
different
areas
,
primarily
within
the
public
domain
,
in
which
ai
can
create
a
significant
impact
.
these
areas
include
transportation
,
home\/service
robotics
,
healthcare
,
education
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
and
security
,
employment
and
workplace
,
and
entertainment
.
although
all
of
these
areas
facilitate
an
incredible
environment
for
ai
integration
,
they
also
imply
a
serious
risk
of
human
suspicion
and
,
potentially
,
retaliation
.
the
study
does
mention
that
there
are
certain
negative
human
reactions
that
will
almost
assuredly
take
place
with
the
introduction
of
ai
.
in
addition
to
the
benefits
of
ai
within
these
areas
,
such
as
safer
roads
,
analysis
of
problems
in
low-resource
communities
,
and
streamlining
of
work
,
the
presence
of
ai
will
also
cause
human
distrust
,
aggravation
at
losses
of
jobs
,
etc.
.
i
believe
that
the
area
in
which
these
problems
will
be
most
focused
will
be
in
public
safety
and
security
.
the
study
notes
that
ai
has
the
potential
to
make
the
public
substantially
safer
through
such
systems
as
cybersecurity
,
surveillance
,
and
predictive
policing
.
i
absolutely
agree
with
these
points
.
however
,
the
study
states
only
that
these
systems
may
cause
nervousness
in
the
public
.
i
believe
that
,
in
such
an
important
realm
as
safety
and
security
,
the
support
of
the
people
is
an
absolute
must
.
when
people
believe
that
their
privacy
is
in
danger
or
that
outside
forces
are
perhaps
manipulating
or
observing
their
information
,
the
retaliation
can
be
extremely
severe
.
if
the
integration
of
ai
,
which
automates
and
expands
much
of
the
security
systems
people
are
attentive
of
,
is
not
communicated
and
accepted
fully
by
the
public
,
i
believe
that
people
will
react
much
more
negatively
than
simply
``
suspiciously
.
''
as
an
example
,
people
were
already
upset
at
having
the
government
look
through
their
private
information
without
any
permission
.
if
that
surveillance
was
expanded
to
security
forces
,
or
even
companies
and
businesses
,
and
automated
with
ai
,
people
would
not
only
be
more
angry
at
all
of
the
related
organizations
but
they
would
immediately
distrust
the
ais
that
are
actually
fantasticly
beneficial
tools
.
in
summation
,
i
believe
that
the
study
downplays
the
negative
reaction
of
human
beings
to
ai
in
the
domain
of
public
safety
and
security
.
if
this
behavior
is
not
accounted
for
,
the
characterization
of
ai
in
the
public
's
eye
could
be
severely
damaged
,
thus
crippling
an
incredibly
useful
tool
which
could
have
