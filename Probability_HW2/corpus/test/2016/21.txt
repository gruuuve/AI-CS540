can
ai
replace
human
teaching
?
artificial
intelligence
plays
a
key
role
in
efficiently
incorporating
different
devices
.
with
the
development
of
different
technologies
,
digital
systems
applications
are
continuing
to
cover
a
wide
range
of
areas
.
digital
technologies
have
been
involved
in
education
in
relatively
long
period
of
time
.
one
of
the
key
challenges
in
incorporating
education
and
ai
is
to
develop
a
better
ai
-
human
interaction
.
according
to
the
article
,
even
though
ai
has
been
actively
used
in
education
,
ai
is
not
going
``
to
fully
replace
human
teaching
in
schools
''
.
however
,
with
the
development
of
several
subfields
there
is
a
good
probability
that
in
the
future
computers
may
fully
replace
human
teaching
.
prevalence
of
computing
systems
led
to
the
dramatic
increase
in
data
produce
.
one
of
the
main
tasks
in
artificial
intelligence
is
to
efficiently
retrieve
and
analyze
the
big
data
stored
.
machine
learning
,
one
of
the
subfields
in
computer
science
,
enables
the
system
to
learn
from
collected
data
.
this
field
enables
the
system
to
learn
about
the
``
subject
''
.
moreover
,
reinforcement
learning
allows
the
machine
to
make
clever
decisions
according
to
learned
data
.
with
the
development
of
ai
,
these
subfields
may
substantially
change
the
learning
process
.
program
may
collect
data
about
a
student
and
make
a
thorough
analysis
about
student
's
weaknesses
and
strong
sides
.
people
tend
to
do
the
same
mistake
consciously
or
unconsciously
.
its
easier
for
the
program
to
see
the
pattern
in
data
which
may
be
collection
of
test
results
,
questions
and
etc.
.
however
,
there
might
be
problems
with
the
classification
of
data
for
the
machine
to
learn
from
them
,
since
the
student
is
more
complex
case
then
,
for
example
,
``
go
''
game
.
therefore
,
if
the
problems
in
this
field
regarding
student
analysis
and
evaluation
will
be
resolved
,
it
will
help
to
create
a
good
intelligent
tutoring
system
.
one
of
the
main
challenges
in
ai
is
machine
--
human
interaction
.
according
to
the
article
,
there
are
several
advancements
in
natural
language
processing
.
there
is
a
good
progress
-lrb-
for
some
languages
-rrb-
in
real
time
translation
and
speech
recognition
.
however
,
natural
conversation
with
the
machine
is
not
even
close
to
reality
.
the
user
should
be
aware
of
some
fallacies
of
the
system
to
have
a
conversation
.
and
also
,
one
should
know
about
the
specific
purpose
of
the
system
to
get
its
full
potential
.
language
is
the
complex
method
of
communication
.
there
are
several
rules
that
may
not
follow
the
logic
and
also
many
ways
of
expressing
the
same
thing
.
people
use
sarcasm
which
most
likely
computer
may
not
understand
.
these
are
the
challenges
engineers
and
linguists
should
solve
.
nevertheless
,
human
interaction
is
one
the
main
aspects
in
education
,
and
its
one
of
the
main
reasons
preventing
computers
from
taking
over
education
.
in
conclusion
,
among
many
other
fields
that
will
contribute
to
the
usage
of
computers
in
education
,
reinforcement
learning
and
natural
language
learning
might
play
a
huge
role
.
in
case
of
reinforcement
learning
,
a
one
of
the
main
issues
in
using
this
field
in
education
and
human
interaction
might
be
the
big
number
of
variations
in
data
.
for
example
,
when
one
wants
to
use
this
method
to
create
a
master
chess
player
,
one
has
a
set
of
historical
chess
games
for
the
machine
to
learn
.
but
what
kinds
of
data
should
be
used
to
analyze
student
performance
?
on
the
other
hand
,
natural
language
learning
faces
the
problems
of
understanding
languages
and
giving
constructive
responses
to
questions
.
therefore
,
there
is
a
chance
of
ai
completely
replacing
human
teaching
,
if
these
and
other
issues
will
be
resolved
.
