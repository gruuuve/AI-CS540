i
do
not
agree
with
the
aspect
about
vehicles
being
self-driven
in
the
present
or
near
future
.
i
think
that
self-driven
cars
would
have
many
more
downfalls
that
it
would
benefits
.
it
would
be
an
unfathomable
thing
to
perceive
because
in
order
for
it
to
go
off
flawlessly
without
any
errors
there
would
need
to
be
a
disbursement
of
all
vehicles
that
are
self-driven
or
a
chip
to
put
in
a
phone
that
can
determine
where
there
is
a
person
.
deaths
would
be
the
biggest
downfall
of
the
self-driven
vehicle
every
making
it
too
far
in
the
world
as
a
few
deaths
from
a
vehicle
that
is
being
ai
driven
could
end
production
fairly
quickly
.
as
brought
up
in
the
reading
,
the
self-driven
car
would
just
generate
more
programs
for
people
to
hack
into
and
reprogram
to
do
other
things
.
it
could
be
devastating
if
the
right
twisted
person
were
to
hack
into
a
self-driven
vehicle
and
attack
someone
with
the
car
.
beyond
that
there
could
be
countless
things
that
could
error
out
the
vehicle
in
driving
because
driving
is
n't
always
a
mind
numbing
task
.
someone
could
be
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
a
hill
,
an
animal
could
jump
out
causing
an
accident
which
in
turn
could
be
like
a
domino
effect
on
other
self-driven
cars
following
closely
behind
.
this
is
a
great
idea
to
have
ai
driven
cars
but
it
would
take
many
years
of
testing
before
it
could
be
introduced
into
more
mainstream
cities
at
full
force
.
new
york
in
particular
could
cause
a
lot
of
problems
if
an
error
occurred
ever
in
the
vehicles
programming
.
the
issue
with
disbursing
or
finding
a
way
to
put
a
locating
device
on
every
person
to
avoid
accidents
would
mainly
be
money
issues
but
at
the
same
time
is
also
a
privacy
issue
.
privacy
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
would
be
an
issue
if
more
ai
things
were
implemented
in
the
world
.
there
are
already
enough
ways
people
can
gather
your
information
if
need
be
and
although
ai
may
make
it
easier
and
in
some
cases
it
may
be
different
information
.
if
a
person
truly
wanted
to
steal
information
regarding
a
person
they
could
via
other
ways
such
as
the
credit
card
scanners
that
allow
people
to
steal
credit
card
numbers
,
spam
emails
requesting
information
,
or
spam
phone
calls
stating
they
are
a
person
or
company
of
importance
.
people
are
always
going
to
be
overly
protective
of
their
information
but
if
they
realize
that
just
about
anything
they
do
electronically
can
risk
their
information
being
stolen
then
they
may
ease
up
on
the
situation
.
i
do
believe
that
it
would
not
be
an
issue
of
privacy
to
have
more
ai
applications
that
people
use
on
a
regular
basis
.
the
pros
would
outweigh
the
cons
for
benefits
over
privacy
issues
.
these
ai
applications
could
even
help
benefit
the
mood
of
society
by
adjusting
to
the
users
preferences
and
making
the
applications
more
enjoyable
to
be
on
throughout
an
extended
period
of
time
.
