in
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
experts

in

-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
,
came
together
to
discuss
and
write
up
a
full
report
on
the
state
of
ai
.
this
report
includes
various
opportunities
that
ai
has
,
as
well
as
the
problems
that
these
advancements
face
.
as
ai
becomes
more
commonplace
in
our
lives
and
evolve
,
regulations
will
need
to
be
reformed
by
government
agencies
.
it
is
important
that
these
regulations
effectively
address
the
human
element
in
ai
and
do
n't
inhibit
technological
advancement
.
these
regulations
should
address
issues
such
as
privacy
and
liability
.
educating
policy
makers
and
the
general
public
on
how
these
technologies
work
is
crucial
to
avoiding
a
slump
in
ai
's
advancement
.
misconceptions
on
what
ai
is
capable
of
slowing
advancement
.
although
hollywood
is
convincing
in
their
portrayal
of
dystopian
future
concerning
ai
,
the
issue
is
that
these
technologies
are
no
where
near
close
to
where
we
are
currently
.
if
this
is
where
the
majority
of
the
general
public
gets
their
notion
of
what
ai
is
,
then
businesses
will
have
trouble
selling
their
products
.
this
would
slow
down
advancement
in
the
industry
,
as
funding
for
research
teams
is
crucial
to
how
fast
we
can
advance
ai
technologies
.
educating
the
general
public
will
certainly
be
a
mountain
on
its
own
.
educating
older
generations
might
be
a
lost
cause
by
now
they
have
their
misconceptions
.
to
reverse
or
stop
these
misconceptions
one
would
need
to
teach
the
public
in
computer
science
in
depth
.
so
,
although
it
may
not
happen
in
generations
that
have
already
gone
through
high
school
and
college
,
today
's
kids
are
being
taught
coding
and
programming
at
an
earlier
age
and
basic
computer
science
knowledge
is
becoming
stressed
more
and
more
.
ai
might
have
to
wait
for
more
knowledgeable
users
and
regulators
in
order
for
technological
advancements
to
be
accepted
.
once
accepted
then
we
need
to
turn
our
focus
towards
how
ai
advancements
are
handled
,
which
could
be
the
biggest
risk
that
ai
truly
poses
.
as
we
are
able
to
search
through
larger
and
larger
amounts
of
data
sets
,
issues
of
privacy
arise
.
internet
companies
already
use
ai
and
user
's
search
history
to
target
advertisements
and
products
towards
consumers
.
if
this
is
not
regulated
companies
,
governments
,
and
malicious
organizations
could
dive
deeper
into
the
public
's
lives
with
greater
ease
.
access
to
cameras
,
drones
,
and
new
personalized
technology
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
greater
accumulation
of
data
on
the
average
person
.
this
means
that
policy
makers
and
developers
need
to
be
more
delicate
with
what
information
these
technologies
are
gathering
.
as
well
as
who
is
allowed
access
to
them
,
and
making
sure
access
to
them
is
secure
.
making
new
ai
developments
safe
and
secure
will
be
a
must
for
innovators
.
what
happens
when
circumstances
arise
and
this
technology
does
fail
?
liability
is
a
huge
issue
if
a
database
is
compromised
,
smart
cars
crash
,
and
other
ai
failures
are
to
arise
.
should
the
company
who
is
profiting
off
of
the
new
technology
be
held
accountable
in
the
event
of
failures
?
what
if
the
reason
for
the
incident
was
due
to
a
user-computer
interaction
that
was
not
taken
into
account
?
is
it
still
the
companies
fault
or
was
it
because
the
user
was
uninformed
?
many
more
questions
arise
when
it
comes
to
liability
as
technology
advances
and
this
will
require
a
greater
understanding
of
these
products
by
policy
makers
.
