the
2016
report
from
the
study
panel
of
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
reviewed
ai
s
progress
in
the
recent
years
,
and
described
the
technical
and
societal
challenges
and
opportunities
along
with
the
potential
advances
.
this
study
successfully
provided
expert-informed
guidance
for
directions
in
ai
research
,
development
,
and
systems
design
.
also
,
provided
programs
and
policies
to
help
ensure
that
these
systems
broadly
benefit
individuals
and
society
.
the
study
panel
,
comprising
experts
in
ai
and
other
relevant
areas
focused
their
attention
on
eight
domains
,
one
of
the
domain
is
public
safety
and
security
.
though
a
rigorous
summarization
of
good
effect
of
ai
technologies
on
public
security
has
been
reported
.
however
,
as
no
technology
will
work
perfectly
,
i
think
there
is
a
need
for
benchmarks
that
identify
acceptable
performance
standards
.
how
will
such
benchmarks
be
established
?
the
answer
to
this
question
needs
to
define
as
precisely
as
possible
before
further
improvement
in
the
public
security
domain
.
i
would
like
to
address
another
concern
that
will
have
a
real
and
direct
impact
on
national
security
.
autonomous
drone
operations
will
increase
rapidly
in
the
next
ten
years
.
by
autonomous
i
am
referring
to
the
complete
absence
of
a
human
operator
.
in
our
military
,
as
the
number
and
employment
of
these
systems
rises
,
the
unit
cost
will
decrease
which
will
make
them
increasingly
more
expendable
.
however
,
unlike
a
human
brain
which
dies
with
the
body
,
the
brain
of
an
autonomous
vehicle
can
be
recovered
.
it
can
be
decrypted
,
restored
,
hacked
and
exploited
,
even
after
the
autonomous
vehicle
it
controlled
is
no
longer
functional
.
while
autonomous
vehicles
may
be
expendable
at
that
time
,
the
information
inside
their
solid
state
brain
,
is
not
.
that
information
could
allow
any
adversary
to
have
an
insight
into
our
military
operations
.
the
countless
scenarios
and
ways
in
which
this
could
unfold
are
beyond
imagination
.
the
solution
is
not
to
have
more
ai
controlled
vehicles
in
military
operations
,
but
rather
to
find
an
effective
way
to
destroy
the
data
when
a
vehicle
is
at
risk
of
being
exploited
.
moreover
,
in
the
context
of
human
subject
research
,
each
individual
has
the
right
to
decide
whether
to
participate
in
a
study
.
subjects
must
be
given
the
opportunity
to
choose
what
shall
or
shall
not
happen
to
them
.
there
have
been
notable
examples
where
social
media
companies
subjected
their
users
to
experiments
aimed
at
improving
their
ai
algorithms
.
we
must
think
beyond
terms
of
service
to
define
a
consent
process
.
otherwise
,
we
might
lose
public
trust
.
