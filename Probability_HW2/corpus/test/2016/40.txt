there
is
a
fast
progress
in
the
development
of
self-driving
cars
in
the
last
few
decades
and
some
companies
like
google
have
already
had
their
prototypes
which
are
being
tested
for
future
deployment
in
near
horizon
.
however
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
is
debatable
that
self-driving
cars
are
believed
to
spread
widely
by
2020
,
according
to
e
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
.
my
concerns
regarding
self-driving
cars
include
three
aspects
:
ethics
debate
,
social\/economy
change
and
potentially
questionable
reliability
.
speaking
of
ethics
for
self-driving
cars
,
it
is
still
not
clear
that
whether
they
are
supposed
to
be
run
by
the
government
as
a
branch
of
public
transportation
or
run
by
the
private
companies
like
uber
.
if
private
companies
take
control
of
self-driving
cars
,
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
definitely
going
to
be
a
conflict
between
those
companies
and
other
taxi
companies
because
most
taxi
companies
would
have
a
hard
time
making
profit
.
however
,
if
government
run
self-driving
car
business
,
public
transportation
drivers
would
lose
their
jobs
,
which
became
a
burden
for
the
government
to
take
care
of
them
.
besides
,
no
matter
who
is
going
to
run
self-driving
car
business
,
it
is
even
more
complicated
when
car
accident
and
causality
are
involved
.
people
might
not
trust
their
lives
on
self-driving
cars
because
they
have
no
control
of
them
and
they
can
not
even
do
anything
when
something
emergency
happens
.
social\/economy
change
brought
by
self-driving
car
business
is
also
worth
concerning
.
when
self-driving
car
business
took
place
,
lots
of
drivers
would
lose
their
jobs
,
which
could
cause
big
problems
.
socially
speaking
,
after
the
``
driver
''
profession
disappeared
,
those
people
would
become
the
unstable
population
in
society
since
they
lost
their
income
and
some
of
them
might
cause
riots
,
chaos
and
crimes
,
which
would
weaken
the
security
in
society
.
even
though
they
wanted
to
get
new
jobs
,
it
was
not
easy
to
learn
new
professions
.
economically
speaking
,
the
economy
would
be
affected
after
``
driver
''
profession
was
not
longer
needed
and
car
insurance
companies
were
put
into
an
awkward
situation
.
since
nobody
would
buy
car
insurance
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
insurance
companies
should
make
business
with
self-driving
car
business
or
they
are
no
longer
needed
just
like
the
``
driver
''
profession
.
another
reasonable
concern
is
the
reliability
of
self-driving
cars
.
it
is
known
to
the
public
that
hackers
do
exist
and
they
might
do
something
really
horrible
when
they
are
threatened
by
terrorists
.
just
imagine
another
``
9\/11
''
attack
with
a
self-driving
vehicle
full
of
explosives
.
it
is
highly
doubtable
that
completely
secure
self-driving
control
unit
is
practical
enough
to
be
built
.
even
in
theory
there
was
a
self-driving
system
,
the
cities
would
cease
to
function
when
the
maintenance
was
in
progress
and
self-driving
cars
were
shut
down
.
technically
,
it
is
likely
that
self-driving
cars
are
going
to
be
ready
to
put
into
practice
into
the
market
in
near
future
.
however
,
the
reliability
of
self-driving
cars
is
still
not
optimistic
.
besides
,
it
is
far
from
enough
to
just
consider
the
technology
itself
because
there
are
other
factors
that
restrain
the
technology
in
use
:
the
ethics
and
social\/economy
change
.
