it
is
na
ve
to
believe
that
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
has
no
cause
for
concern
that
ai
is
an
imminent
threat
to
humankind
.
with
the
exponential
growth
of
technology
within
the
past
decade
,
vast
changes
will
be
made
in
the
upcoming
years
for
better
or
worse
.
even
the
study
panel
believes
that
there
will
be
a
different
society
by
2030
,
but
to
be
able
to
predict
whether
or
not
it
will
be
a
futuristic
utopian
,
we
can
not
be
sure
.
the
stanford
study
panel
may
be
ignoring
the
fact
that
as
fantasies
of
flying
cars
and
service
robots
come
closer
to
fruition
,
nothing
can
be
ruled
out
,
including
robots
used
for
malicious
intents
.
the
article
also
states
,
no
machines
with
self-sustaining
long-term
goals
and
intent
have
been
developed
,
nor
are
they
likely
to
be
developed
in
the
near
future
.
we
should
not
ignore
the
fact
that
there
are
people
,
geniuses
,
with
not-so-good
motives
.
in
such
a
way
that
big
corporations
tend
to
be
greedy
and
hurt
the
people
for
its
own
benefits
,
robots
could
be
programmed
in
such
a
way
to
aid
those
corporations
.
remember
that
there
are
hackers
out
there
with
good
intents
and
evil
intents
.
the
world
could
not
exist
without
the
good
and
bad
,
so
the
study
panel
should
not
be
so
quick
to
rule
out
the
latter
.
within
time
,
things
will
inevitably
change
and
the
panel
s
-lrb-
somewhat
utopian
-rrb-
idea
of
a
futuristic
society
may
or
may
not
hold
.
for
example
,
the
arms
race
during
the
cold
war
showed
how
technology
can
pose
a
threat
to
humanity
.
in
the
future
,
we
could
possibly
see
robots
be
used
for
war
.
it
would
be
nice
that
instead
of
human
soldiers
who
are
risking
their
lives
,
there
would
be
intelligent
machines
out
on
the
battlefield
.
but
they
could
also
be
the
enemies
.
it
does
sound
like
a
clich
sci-fi
film
,
but
really
anything
can
happen
.
another
point
that
was
made
in
the
article
is
that
crowdsourcing
and
human
computation
is
a
big
factor
of
artificial
intelligence
.
the
study
panel
made
a
point
that
the
best-known
example
of
crowdsourcing
is
wikipedia
,
a
knowledge
repository
that
is
maintained
and
updated
by
netizens
,
and
wikipedia
is
undeniably
a
great
resource
.
however
,
many
understand
that
it
is
not
entirely
reliable
,
because
there
are
people
who
feed
bad
information
.
of
course
that
only
needs
to
be
regulated
,
but
we
should
ask
,
what
effect
will
be
made
if
the
mistake
goes
unnoticed
?
such
technology
has
a
long
way
of
being
tried
and
tested
before
being
placed
into
our
society
.
the
technological
advances
that
have
been
made
within
the
few
past
years
show
a
promising
future
.
however
,
we
ve
seen
them
succeed
and
fail
.
one
twitter
account
,
taytweets
,
was
microsoft
s
attempt
at
introducing
artificial
intelligence
to
millennials
.
however
,
as
a
news
article
in
telegraph
called
it
,
the
teen
girl
became
a
hitler-loving
sex
robot
within
24
hours
and
had
to
be
closed
down
.
this
is
a
small
scale
example
of
how
citizens
can
easily
expose
the
flaws
of
ai
and
turn
it
into
an
unwelcomed
event
.
the
standford
study
panel
articulately
explains
the
benefits
of
innovating
ai
and
it
surely
will
make
our
world
a
better
place
.
but
for
now
,
some
of
their
views
are
neglecting
the
dangers
of
such
ideas
.
