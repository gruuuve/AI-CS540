the
report
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
is
pretty
awesome
,
and
most
of
its
points
are
very
convincing
.
but
i
have
a
different
view
on
carpooling
.
also
,
i
think
that
the
combination
of
cv
-lrb-
computer
vision
-rrb-
and
ai
-lrb-
e.g.
facial
recognition
-rrb-
,
which
is
missing
in
this
report
,
can
also
influence
people
's
life
a
lot
in
a
near
future
and
may
gain
public
trust
before
transportation
ai
system
.
as
for
the
carpooling
,
i
believe
that
it
can
gain
traction
on
a
large
scale
in
a
near
future
with
the
spread
of
uber
and
lyft
.
in
the
report
,
it
is
said
that
current
approaches
of
carpooling
-lrb-
i.e.
zimride
and
nuride
-rrb-
have
failed
to
gain
traction
on
a
large
scale
.
however
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
reason
why
the
expending
of
zimride
and
nuride
failed
was
that
they
were
not
so
famous
at
that
time
.
uber
and
lyft
are
great
and
suitable
platform
for
carpooling
.
actually
,
uber
has
released
their
uberpool
service
in
big
cities
such
as
san
francisco
and
new
york
city
.
uberpool
allows
users
to
share
their
ride
and
split
the
cost
of
their
trip
with
another
uber
rider
headed
in
the
same
direction
.
lyft
has
also
released
a
similar
service
.
when
i
was
an
intern
in
the
bay
area
,
i
always
took
uberpool
when
i
was
out
.
i
think
uberpool
will
be
very
popular
among
users
as
users
can
save
more
money
taking
uberpool
when
compared
to
taking
uberx
,
uberxl
or
taxi
.
also
,
drivers
can
earn
more
money
by
taking
more
passengers
.
and
,
maybe
most
importantly
,
uberpool
can
even
save
the
resources
of
the
society
and
reduce
environment
pollution
.
with
the
development
of
ai
technologies
,
people
will
learn
more
about
the
convenience
of
carpooling
and
be
willing
to
use
carpooling
.
after
that
,
i
think
uberpool
will
be
popular
all
over
the
usa
and
other
countries
.
as
for
the
combination
of
cv
and
ai
-lrb-
e.g.
facial
recognition
-rrb-
,
i
believe
that
it
can
influence
people
's
life
in
many
different
ways
in
a
very
near
future
.
imagine
that
,
when
you
go
back
home
,
you
do
n't
need
physical
keys
.
what
you
need
to
do
is
just
smiling
at
your
door
and
doing
some
specific
actions
.
after
that
,
your
door
will
open
automatically
.
also
,
when
you
use
your
mobile
paypal
to
purchase
something
online
,
you
do
n't
need
to
enter
your
password
anymore
.
instead
,
you
just
need
to
open
the
camera
and
ask
your
phone
to
recognize
you
using
facial
recognition
-lrb-
you
may
be
asked
to
do
some
specific
actions
like
smiling
-rrb-
.
this
functionality
has
already
been
supported
in
alipay
-lrb-
chinese
paypal
-rrb-
.
facial
recognition
can
make
people
's
life
much
easier
.
people
may
worry
about
the
security
issues
of
these
technologies
--
are
they
100
%
reliable
?
no
,
they
are
not
.
but
physical
keys
and
fingerprint
identification
are
also
not
100
%
reliable
.
facebook
's
facial
recognition
technology
has
already
reached
a
97
%
accuracy
rate
of
authenticity
.
when
we
need
to
increase
the
security
level
,
we
can
just
use
combination
of
these
technologies
.
besides
facebook
recognition
,
researchers
also
develop
image
recognition
,
image
detection
and
other
image
related
technologies
a
lot
in
the
past
few
years
.
for
example
,
in
2015
,
researchers
from
microsoft
research
asia
won
imagenet
computer
vision
challenge
and
the
accuracy
of
their
system
met
and
sometimes
exceed
human-level
performance
.
all
in
all
,
i
believe
that
carpooling
and
the
combination
of
cv
and
ai
will
influence
people
's
life
a
great
deal
in
the
near
future
.
