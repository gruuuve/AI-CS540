artificial
intelligence
is
deeming
to
be
one
of
the
driving
forces
our
world
has
to
look
forward
to
in
the
near
future
.
with
self-driving
cars
,
better
health
care
treatments
,
and
drone
delivery
service
,
what
more
could
we
ask
for
?
with
all
this
impressive
technology
ready
to
reveal
itself
to
our
society
,
the
worries
anyone
has
are
on
the
low-end
of
our
attention
.
but
what
if
we
really
think
about
what
new
ai
technologies
will
mean
for
our
population
?
according
to
the
study
,
researchers
want
to
make
sure
they
do
n't
``
marginalize
humans
.
''
they
would
n't
want
humans
to
feel
insignificant
or
useless
,
as
the
robotic
technology
of
the
future
takes
over
simple
household
jobs
and
most
other
jobs
that
we
are
now
employed
with
.
the
goal
of
ai
,
is
to
``
replace
people
in
certain
types
of
jobs
,
such
as
the
driving
of
taxis
and
trucks
''
-lrb-

.
even
if
this
makes
certain
aspects
of
transportation
easier
,
are
n't
we
losing
jobs
to
these
programs
?
as
of
august
2016
,
the
unemployment
rate
in
north
america
is
up
to
5
%
.
-lrb-
http://countryeconomy.com/unemployment
-rrb-
.
``
ai
will
likely
replace
tasks
rather
than
jobs
in
the
near
term
,
and
will
also
create
new
kinds
of
jobs
''
-lrb-
pg
8
-rrb-
,
but
we
can
not
be
confident
that
this
is
how
it
will
turn
out
.
if
there
is
a
plan
to
create
new
kinds
of
jobs
,
what
level
of
expertise
or
education
will
someone
need
to
fulfill
these
job
requirements
?
there
is
no
proof
determining
whether
or
not
the
unemployment
rate
will
increase
or
decrease
.
has
it
gotten
better
due
to
ai
technology
in
the
past
years
or
has
it
gotten
worse
?
they
know
that
existing
jobs
will
be
lost
,
so
i
would
like
to
know
exactly
how
they
will
be
replacing
these
jobs
,
as
well
as
increasing
employment
,
before
ai
technology
takes
over
the
jobs
we
partake
in
,
in
our
everyday
lives
.
``
the
measure
of
success
for
ai
applications
is
the
value
they
create
for
human
lives
''
-lrb-
pg
10
-rrb-
.
some
goals
that
would
create
more
value
in
humans
lives
,
for
example
,
are
;
interactive
machine
tutors
,
ai
machines
to
work
with
caregivers
as
well
as
patients
-lrb-
while
also
learning
to
gain
trust
-rrb-
,
robots
designed
to
assist
with
medical
procedures
,
and
many
more
.
all
these
examples
sound
wonderful
,
but
also
,
eventually
,
the
technology
being
used
will
advance
and
be
greater
than
the
human
itself
,
again
,
taking
over
the
jobs
a
human
could
learn
to
do
.
if
these
machines
are
able
to
keep
learning
,
what
will
certain
levels
of
education
be
needed
for
?
