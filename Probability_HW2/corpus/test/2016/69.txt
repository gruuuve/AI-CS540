a
rejoinder
to
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
in
this
report
,
the
authors
claimed
that
adaptive
learning
systems
will
become
a
core
part
of
the
teaching
process
in
higher
education
.
the
adaptive
learning
systems
have
some
advantages
,
such
as
more
interactive
,
flexible
et
al.
,
however
,
the
current
disadvantages
of
the
adaptive
learning
systems
would
limit
their
application
for
teaching
in
higher
education
.
although
the
adaptive
learning
systems
will
provide
more
customizable
approaches
to
learning
,
but
it
would
be
challenge
to
change
the
teachers
'
teaching
style
and
students
'
learning
habits
.
a
lot
of
teachers
would
not
want
to
change
their
ways
since
they
have
using
the
traditional
ways
for
many
years
.
in
addition
,
there
is
no
evidence
show
that
the
adaptive
learning
systems
can
significantly
improve
the
performance
of
the
students
.
moreover
,
these
systems
will
reduce
the
teacher-student
face
time
and
student-student
interaction
in
the
classrooms
.
it
will
require
more
efforts
for
the
students
to
build
the
relationships
with
the
teacher
and
classmates
.
as
we
know
,
the
lack
of
teacher-student
and
student-student
interaction
would
not
only
limit
the
students
'
studying
,
but
also
could
limit
their
professional
development
.
finally
,
the
adaptive
learning
systems
will
require
the
students
have
extraordinary
self-discipline
.
the
students
are
required
to
have
better
time
management
and
organization
skills
,
which
can
make
sure
they
stay
on
top
of
their
work
and
complete
their
course
work
on
time
.
in
contrast
,
the
students
usually
meet
with
their
academic
advisors
to
discuss
their
difficulties
on
study
and
the
advisor
can
help
them
plan
their
study
path
in
traditional
college
.
however
,
if
they
are
using
the
adaptive
learning
systems
,
the
limits
and
problems
of
the
student
are
all
based
on
the
database
,
so
it
will
take
longer
to
find
out
and
solve
the
problems
,
thus
the
students
may
not
be
able
to
make
academic
progress
during
a
period
of
time
.
there
are
other
disadvantages
of
using
adaptive
learning
systems
.
for
example
,
it
will
make
things
very
easy
for
the
students
and
they
may
lose
their
creativity
.
also
,
the
adaptive
learning
systems
can
adapt
to
the
needs
of
students
after
the
systems
get
enough
information
from
the
students
,
in
this
case
,
the
systems
only
have
limited
information
in
the
beginning
when
the
computers
do
not
``
know
''
much
about
the
students
.
in
another
word
,
it
will
take
a
large
amount
of
time
to
develop
the
database
.
so
in
fact
,
the
adaptive
learning
systems
would
not
benefit
the
students
in
a
short
time
.
the
students
may
also
not
be
satisfied
with
the
adaptive
learning
systems
and
would
not
chose
it
over
traditional
classroom
education
.
the
authors
also
indicated
that
the
adaptive
learning
systems
can
contain
cost
while
serving
a
larger
number
of
students
.
however
,
implementing
adaptive
learning
systems
could
be
huge
cost
to
the
schools
.
so
some
colleges
may
could
not
afford
the
cost
of
the
adaptive
learning
systems
and
would
not
using
the
systems
.
in
summary
,
the
adaptive
learning
systems
could
be
useful
tools
for
teaching
in
higher
education
,
but
it
may
not
be
the
core
part
of
the
teaching
process
in
higher
education
.
