in
the
past
few
decades
,
artificial
intelligence
has
developed
in
a
rapid
pace
and
has
improved
human
society
in
various
aspects
.
in
the
report
from
stanford
named
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
has
stated
several
positive
influences
on
low-resources
communities
.
however
,
i
believe
that
ai
has
been
more
inimical
rather
than
beneficial
.
to
begin
with
,
i
have
to
admit
that
ai
has
provided
some
benefits
to
the
low
resource
communities
.
according
to
the
report
,
with
the
help
of
ai
,
government
can
make
use
of
budgets
more
effectively
.
this
is
because
that
ai
could
build
models
based
on
information
collected
.
these
models
are
highly
predictive
in
the
way
that
it
could
present
possible
unfavorable
outcomes
.
as
a
result
,
government
would
be
able
to
pick
the
way
that
yields
least
negative
outcomes
.
however
,
while
improving
the
life
of
low
resource
communities
,
ai
actually
expand
the
communities
.
with
the
development
of
ai
,
many
blue-collar
employees
join
low
resource
communities
since
their
positions
were
taken
by
the
more
effective
ai
.
even
though
ai
currently
is
nowhere
near
the
super
ai
shown
on
movies
,
it
is
intelligent
enough
to
complete
simple
jobs
such
as
packing
in
factories
.
more
importantly
,
ai
merely
makes
any
mistakes
.
with
these
facts
in
mind
,
companies
would
stick
with
ai
for
better
production
as
long
as
the
cost
is
not
drastically
greater
than
using
labor
force
.
thus
,
the
rise
of
the
ai
comes
with
high
unemployment
for
the
blue
collar
.
this
unemployment
is
not
seen
as
a
huge
threat
in
the
report
as
the
author
believes
that
ai
would
at
the
same
time
creates
some
other
job
opportunities
.
nevertheless
,
the
author
did
not
pay
much
attention
on
the
type
of
the
new
jobs
created
.
in
my
opinion
,
jobs
such
as
maintaining
the
ai
hardware
and
operating
things
related
to
the
ai
require
much
highly
specialized
knowledge
in
various
fields
.
therefore
,
people
who
were
blue-collar
employees
are
unlikely
to
pick
up
the
skills
and
therefore
the
unemployed
people
are
not
likely
to
get
those
jobs
.
other
than
expanding
low-resource
communities
,
the
benefits
mentioned
in
the
previous
paragraph
are
not
enough
to
make
the
low-resource
communities
to
be
truly
happy
.
this
is
because
those
benefits
are
merely
physical
and
i
believe
that
a
more
important
aspect
of
their
mental
health
should
be
concerned
.
even
though
with
the
physical
benefits
provided
by
ai
,
they
might
be
able
to
live
in
a
decent
environment
,
what
should
they
do
instead
of
working
?
as
it
is
known
,
working
is
a
large
part
of
one
s
life
.
without
working
or
studying
,
people
tend
to
lose
themselves
,
as
they
are
unable
to
set
a
specific
goal
and
work
towards
it
.
in
addition
,
many
entertainments
would
not
be
so
fun
without
the
comparison
with
work
.
as
a
result
,
one
would
usually
be
spiritually
unsatisfied
if
he
does
not
work
daily
.
in
conclusion
,
the
statement
mentioned
in
the
report
about
ai
improving
life
of
low-resource
communities
is
valid
to
a
certain
extent
.
however
,
it
is
generally
inimical
since
it
actually
expands
low-resource
communities
,
creates
jobs
that
are
only
suitable
for
well-educated
people
and
provides
little
or
even
no
mental
help
to
them
.
