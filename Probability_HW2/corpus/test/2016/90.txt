the
first
aspect
of
the
report
which
can
be
challenged
is
the
optimistic
view
on
the
future
of
self
driving
car
technology
.
the
report
claims
that
sensing
algorithms
will
achieve
super-human
performance
with
respect
to
capabilities
required
for
driving
.
while
it
might
be
true
that
sensing
algorithms
will
drastically
improve
in
performance
and
accuracy
,
the
claim
that
they
will
reach
super
human
performance
is
not
supported
with
relevant
references
or
further
explanation
.
on
the
basis
of
this
assumption
and
a
business
insider
report
it
is
stated
that
the
number
of
self
driving
cars
will
be
more
than
10
million
in
2020
.
given
the
current
state
of
affairs
and
the
number
of
roadblocks
both
in
terms
of
regulation
and
safety
concerns
,
the
report
does
not
provide
sufficient
evidence
to
take
on
such
an
optimistic
prediction
about
the
growth
of
self
driving
cars
.
the
second
aspect
of
the
report
that
can
be
challenged
is
the
prediction
of
the
demise
of
individually
owned
cars
.
it
takes
an
optimistic
tone
when
it
describes
the
possibility
that
people
may
forgo
using
individual
cars
and
instead
rely
solely
on
shared
self
driving
cars
and
peer
to
peer
transportation
services
.
one
of
the
most
beneficial
aspect
of
using
peer
to
peer
sharing
transportation
services
like
uber
is
the
amount
of
free
time
a
rider
gains
by
taking
the
shared
car
as
opposed
to
driving
themselves
.
the
report
mentions
that
a
commuter
spends
on
average
twenty
five
minutes
driving
each
way
.
while
it
is
possible
that
people
will
depend
more
on
peer
to
peer
transportation
services
like
uber
and
lyft
for
regular
commute
-lrb-
improvements
in
machine
learning
algorithms
will
make
it
easier
for
riders
to
find
and
book
a
ride
whenever
required
-rrb-
,
the
desire
to
own
a
car
might
only
increase
because
self
driving
cars
would
enable
individuals
to
travel
without
wasting
time
on
driving
,
they
would
be
able
to
use
that
time
to
do
other
productive
activities
.
the
third
aspect
of
the
the
report
which
can
be
challenged
is
the
insufficient
attention
given
to
the
detrimental
impact
hackers
can
have
on
the
safety
and
future
of
autonomous
cars
and
more
broadly
any
autonomous
vehicle
.
while
the
autonomous
car
technology
and
safety
have
been
steadily
increasing
,
there
have
also
been
associated
reports
of
hackers
taking
advantage
of
car
software
vulnerabilities
to
take
over
a
car
remotely
and
in
turn
cause
a
lot
of
damage
.
additionally
,
with
the
widespread
adoption
of
gps
and
internet
enabled
devices
as
well
as
the
rapid
improvement
of
deep
learning
platforms
,
there
has
been
a
proliferation
of
smart
devices
all
over
the
home
and
office
or
in
general
internet
of
things
-lrb-
iot
-rrb-
devices
which
is
one
of
the
hot
areas
of
ai
research
.
the
report
does
a
great
job
of
highlighting
the
impact
these
technologies
and
devices
will
have
in
an
average
user
s
life
,
but
they
fail
to
highlight
the
dangerous
security
flaws
these
devices\/algorithms
may
have
and
how
these
can
be
used
by
hackers
to
take
over\/harm
the
devices
that
people
rely
on
in
their
homes
and
on
the
road
as
well
as
how
this
will
tremendously
slow
down
the
process
to
get
required
government
regulation
for
widespread
usage
of
these
devices
.
