in
my
opinion
,
the
prophecy
of
ai
on
medicine
is
quite
overestimated
.
i
think
the
upper-bound
of
ai
in
this
touchy
area
is
just
that
ai
can
assist
basic
operations
and
data
measuring
.
actually
i
am
really
optimistic
about
medicine
ai
.
the
passage
mainly
talks
about
the
promising
future
of
ai
with
some
concerns
about
social
security
and
federal
constraints
.
however
,
they
ignore
two
essential
parts
,
the
progress
of
medicine
itself
and
the
industry
properties
.
1
.
modern
medicine
largely
depends
on
the
experiments
in
labs
and
the
clinical
tests
.
even
though
we
give
enough
so-called
theories
to
explain
one
to
another
,
we
still
seldom
tell
what
is
wrong
with
exceptions
.
life
is
such
a
complexity
full
of
unknowns
that
we
can
not
simply
put
in
ingredients
to
modify
or
fix
.
according
to
this
chaos
in
theories
,
we
develop
varieties
of
ways
to
treat
the
patients
which
have
some
goods
and
also
some
bads
.
even
human
can
not
figure
out
what
is
right
to
choose
,
how
could
the
ai
be
responsible
for
the
cures
.
in
this
aspect
,
what
i
am
trying
to
tell
is
that
the
medicine
is
on
a
very
embryo
period
in
its
history
,
we
face
too
many
uncertainties
.
there
is
one
saying
about
modern
medicine
,
the
only
thing
that
has
a
cure
in
modern
medicine
is
bacterial
infection
.
the
saying
in
some
way
can
reveal
how
weak
we
human
are
when
faced
with
so
many
threatens
of
life
.
knowing
that
we
have
too
many
challenges
ahead
in
medicine
,
the
ai
may
even
have
a
much
farther
way
.
2
.
the
industry
properties
.
in
fact
,
this
reason
follows
the
first
reason
directly
.
as
we
do
not
own
a
theory
of
certainty
,
sometimes
things
get
tough
.
every
year
we
face
too
many
medical
accidents
which
result
in
millions
of
conflicts
between
doctors
and
patients
.
we
all
know
doctors
have
much
more
patients
cured
than
those
who
weren
t.
however
,
the
society
is
only
concerned
about
the
latter
.
it
means
the
industry
is
of
very
low
satisfaction
.
misdiagnose
will
result
in
severe
disrepute
.
we
assume
that
there
being
a
good
ai
technology
can
work
out
good
solutions
for
patients
.
with
the
certainty
of
an
algorithm
,
we
may
lead
the
similar
patients
to
similar
results
with
similar
side-effects
.
the
outcome
of
treatment
might
be
as
good
as
it
can
be
.
but
patients
have
different
levels
of
tolerance
to
the
side-effects
both
on
physical
and
mental
.
as
the
patient
community
share
the
similar
side-effects
,
they
can
enhance
the
feeling
of
being
misdiagnosed
.
in
this
situation
truth
may
matter
little
.
the
pressure
from
the
society
and
media
will
strike
down
the
spread
of
this
technology
.
there
will
undoubtedly
be
a
jihad
of
anti-ai
.
on
this
point
,
i
emphasize
the
low
satisfaction
of
the
industry
.
even
if
we
get
a
theoretical-best
solution
,
we
still
have
to
handle
the
comments
from
the
patient
community
.
as
there
is
just
a
program
with
no
medical
certificate
to
diagnose
you
,
we
the
patients
will
always
worry
more
.
the
bad
results
can
be
greatly
amplified
.
it
is
not
only
a
challenge
but
also
an
inevitable
topic
in
the
progress
of
this
technology
.
according
to
the
two
reasons
above
,
we
should
not
give
too
much
expectations
on
ai
for
the
medical
diagnosing
in
the
near
future
.
however
,
the
benefits
of
data
measuring
as
well
as
the
assisting
in
medical
operations
can
never
be
ignored
.
i
would
like
to
say
there
must
be
a
long
way
for
ai
to
get
through
on
medicine
,
we
may
not
see
much
in
the
coming
15
years
.
but
you
can
never
figure
out
what
the
future
is
really
like
.
