artificial
intelligence
will
be
able
to
rapidly
replace
all
human
jobs
,
including
those
which
are
largely
cognitive
or
involve
judgement
.
i
find
this
statement
from
the
article
highly
dubitable
for
the
reasons
discussed
below
.
firstly
,
launch
of
new
products
,
innovation
,
expansion
of
businesses
and
start
of
new
ones
requires
new
ideas
and
vision
.
this
is
something
which
we
can
not
train
the
machines
for
just
yet
.
we
can
only
teach
a
machine
what
we
already
know
.
as
discussed
in
the
article
,
human
mind
is
extremely
versatile
.
even
science
has
not
been
able
to
fully
understand
the
infinite
functions
our
minds
can
perform
.
an
intelligent
machine
can
beat
human
mind
in
one
or
multiple
fields
but
to
incorporate
all
the
versatility
into
a
single
machine
seems
impossible
and
improbable
.
the
intuitions
,
emotions
and
decision
making
are
just
a
few
unique
attributes
of
human
mind
and
it
will
take
several
generations
to
train
machines
to
be
able
to
replicate
only
some
of
them
.
so
,
ai
might
not
replace
humans
just
yet
.
secondly
,
when
computers
were
first
introduced
,
there
were
speculations
that
these
superfast
machines
would
simplify
all
human
tasks
and
people
will
lose
jobs
.
it
is
indeed
true
that
computers
have
made
numerous
tasks
easy
to
perform
.
however
,
more
than
replacing
the
already
existing
jobs
,
computers
have
created
an
entire
new
sector
,
which
employs
numerous
people
.
with
time
,
people
have
developed
new
skill
sets
which
help
them
keep
up
with
the
latest
computer
technologies
.
millions
of
people
are
employed
each
year
to
work
on
new
problems
and
challenges
towards
advancements
.
hence
,
it
would
be
incorrect
to
say
that
ai
can
replace
all
kinds
of
jobs
in
a
single
generation
.
thirdly
,
even
if
artificial
intelligence
were
to
grow
very
rapidly
,
the
cost
of
implementing
the
technology
across
the
globe
might
be
too
high
to
be
practically
feasible
.
it
is
entirely
possible
that
some
machines
are
not
at
all
feasible
to
be
mass
produced
,
either
due
to
cost
limitations
or
technology
barriers
.
in
such
cases
,
the
advancements
of
ai
will
be
hindered
.
moreover
,
to
implement
the
machines
at
large
scales
means
complying
with
the
regulatory
policies
,
which
are
only
going
to
get
more
stringent
and
stricter
as
our
reliance
on
machines
increases
.
thus
,
human
jobs
will
continue
to
exist
,
till
all
these
complications
are
resolved
.
therefore
,
i
doubt
that
ai
will
ever
completely
eliminate
the
human
jobs
.
if
opportunities
reduce
or
vanish
in
one
employment
sector
,
new
opportunities
will
be
created
in
other
advancing
sectors
.
it
is
understandable
that
as
the
technology
progresses
and
matures
,
organizations
will
be
inclined
to
invest
more
in
the
capital
than
payrolls
and
labor
,
but
there
will
be
no
replacement
of
the
multifaceted
and
versatile
human
mind
.
therefore
,
mind
and
machines
will
go
hand
in
hand
as
we
step
into
the
future
,
providing
their
assistance
,
whenever
the
other
fails
.
