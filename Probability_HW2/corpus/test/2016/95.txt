one
of
the
biggest
problems
our
civilization
faces
as
it
continues
to
expand
is
traffic
congestion
.
because
of
this
,
as
the
growth
of
technology
becomes
quicker
and
more
advanced
,
this
problem
is
becoming
the
focus
of
many
studies
.
such
studies
that
integrate
the
idea
of
``
autonomous
''
or
``
semi-autonomous
''
vehicles
are
becoming
more
in
depth
,
and
asking
the
right
questions
:
``
who
is
at
fault
during
an
accident
,
the
driver
or
the
car
?
''
or
``
in
a
perilous
situation
,
how
does
the
car
decide
who
to
protect
first
?
''
these
questions
may
not
have
a
definitive
answer
at
the
moment
,
but
the
more
these
technologies
progress
,
the
better
we
will
become
at
understanding
the
power
of
implementing
an
advanced
ai
in
our
vehicles
.
however
,
while
idea
of
``
on-demand
transportation
''
incredibly
beneficial
,
the
question
of
how
this
technology
will
be
used
brings
in
other
questions
and
arguments
.
for
example
,
the
automated
carpooling
by
uber
and
lyft
is
``
seen
as
a
promising
approach
to
decrease
traffic
congestion
''
may
seem
a
little
too
far-fetched
at
the
moment
,
simply
because
of
personal
space
and
other
aspects
of
interacting
with
strangers
(23)
.
people
who
own
cars
do
so
due
to
better
convenience
,
privacy
,
and
-lrb-
usually
-rrb-
cleanliness
,
over
taking
public
transportation
.
if
our
personal
cars
suddenly
because
autonomous
taxis
throughout
the
day
while
we
were
at
work
,
there
is
a
large
chance
that
these
cars
could
end
up
with
stolen
items
,
or
a
with
a
mess
left
for
the
owner
to
clean
up
.
this
being
said
,
while
autonomous
carpooling
is
most
certainly
beneficial
in
the
long
run
,
it
seems
as
though
most
people
are
still
looking
into
ownership
for
their
products
-lrb-
especially
cars
-rrb-
.
once
automated
cars
start
becoming
commonplace
,
i
predict
customers
are
still
going
to
want
their
own
personal
space
,
rather
than
sharing
one
with
strangers
day
after
day
.
this
is
most
likely
the
reason
that
companies
such
as
``
zimride
and
nuride
-lrb-
have
-rrb-
failed
to
gain
traction
on
a
large
scale
''
(23)
