the
stanford
one
hundred
year
paper
predicts
that
home
robot
market
will
prosper
in
2030
.
i
disagree
with
this
prediction
because
home
robots
still
suffer
from
technology
immaturity
and
security
concerns
.
easy
interaction
with
human
is
a
basic
requirement
for
home
robots
to
be
widely
accepted
.
since
vocal
communication
is
the
most
common
and
comfortable
way
of
communication
,
it
is
natural
to
require
home
robots
to
understand
human
languages
and
respond
to
it
fast
and
properly
.
two
important
steps
in
this
process
are
speech
recognition
and
natural
language
processing
.
let
s
discuss
speech
recognition
first
.
leading
it
companies
have
made
huge
progress
in
speech
recognition
,
and
best
speech
recognition
systems
beat
human
with
96
%
accuracy
rate

-rrb-
,
with
deep
learning
techniques
.
however
,
the
extraordinary
accuracy
is
achieved
with
huge
training
sets
and
large
scale
gpu-cpu
heterogeneous
clusters
and
domain
specific
accelerators
like
fpgas
,
programmable
socs
and
even
asics
.
since
dennard
scaling
has
already
ended
and
that
moore
s
law
is
going
to
end
in
the
near
future
,
people
can
not
rely
on
hardware
becoming
small
and
powerful
enough
to
implement
the
speech
recognition
algorithm
locally
15
years
later
,
and
the
huge
amount
of
storage
needed
for
storing
the
trained
model
also
makes
local
implementation
difficult
.
an
obvious
alternative
is
to
implement
the
system
at
cloud
and
provide
interfaces
to
robot
software
developers
.
however
,
this
alternative
also
faces
several
challenges
.
the
first
challenge
is
security
,
which
will
be
discussed
later
,
and
the
second
one
is
network
availability
.
home
network
needs
to
be
highly
stable
to
deliver
service
in
time
,
which
is
vital
to
user
experience
in
human
computer
interaction
.
unlike
speech
recognition
,
natural
language
processing
is
still
mostly
in
research
period
.
since
human
language
systems
are
more
or
less
internally
informal
,
it
is
easy
to
cause
ambiguity
to
humans
,
let
alone
machines
.
moreover
,
up
to
now
,
most
natural
language
processing
research
has
been
focusing
on
understanding
contexts
,
while
communicating
with
human
also
requires
feedbacks
from
robots
or
in
other
words
,
text
generation
.
considering
these
complexities
,
it
is
hard
for
home
robots
to
become
really
social
friendly
in
15
years
.
security
is
another
big
concern
.
relying
on
cloud
computing
to
deliver
services
such
as
speech
recognition
is
an
efficient
method
,
but
it
also
introduces
more
opportunities
to
hijack
a
home
robot
.
home
robots
could
interact
heavily
with
human
beings
and
store
private
daily
information
which
is
hard
to
find
from
other
devices
.
for
example
,
a
home
robot
will
be
equipped
with
all
kinds
of
sensors
to
get
optical
,
vocal
,
temperature
and
numerous
other
information
.
just
imagine
a
hijacked
home
wandering
in
your
home
,
taking
pictures
of
your
daily
activities
and
personal
belongs
and
recording
your
speeches
,
and
even
health
related
information
and
sending
them
to
hackers
for
possible
malicious
usage
.
moreover
,
information
leakage
is
only
a
small
concern
compared
with
the
potential
threats
to
public
security
.
multifunctional
home
robots
hijacked
by
terrorists
could
threaten
lives
directly
because
they
are
too
close
to
people
.
meanwhile
,
the
terrorists
do
not
need
to
get
their
feet
on
the
land
of
the
united
states
when
performing
such
attacks
,
making
tracking
and
arresting
harder
than
today
.
in
summary
,
home
robots
still
face
challenges
in
technology
and
security
,
and
the
prediction
made
in
the
paper
is
probably
over
optimistic
.
