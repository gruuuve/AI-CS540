as
i
read
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
''
i
became
increasingly
fascinated
and
excited
by
the
extent
to
which
artificial
intelligence
can
be
used
to
change
the
world
.
the
amount
of
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
in
our
daily
lives
was
eye-opening
for
me
.
the
research
shows
that
if
used
properly
,
artificial
intelligence
will
be
the
driving
force
in
what
shapes
the
future
of
the
world
.
that
being
said
,
it
is
important
to
understand
and
set
boundaries
for
what
we
allow
ai
to
do
,
specifically
in
healthcare
.
while
advances
in
artificial
intelligence
can
benefit
in
many
ways
,
there
should
be
hesitation
before
relying
too
heavily
on
it
in
healthcare
.
as
we
venture
deeper
and
deeper
into
healthcare
robotics
,
many
moral
issues
start
to
arise
.
when
dealing
with
people
's
health
,
it
's
important
to
be
careful
with
how
procedures
are
practiced
because
you
are
dealing
with
someone
else
's
life
.
surgeries
require
a
very
high
level
of
skill
with
little
room
for
error
and
are
performed
by
doctors
and
surgeons
that
have
an
immense
amount
of
education
to
be
able
to
accurately
perform
those
surgeries
.
being
able
to
create
a
machine
that
is
able
to
incorporate
all
of
this
and
be
able
to
perform
up
to
standard
is
a
challenge
.
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
every
person
and
case
is
different
,
so
it
is
up
to
the
doctor
to
assess
each
case
and
provide
the
proper
care
based
on
the
patient
's
condition
.
with
so
much
variability
,
it
might
be
a
challenge
to
find
a
way
to
successfully
assess
and
operate
on
all
patients
.
given
this
variability
,
``
these
algorithms
are
perhaps
even
more
susceptible
than
people
to
making
assumptions
if
the
data
they
are
trained
on
is
skewed
toward
one
perspective
or
another
''

.
even
if
the
technology
was
perfected
in
healthcare
robotics
,
there
is
still
an
uphill
battle
in
terms
of
morality
.
``
organizations
are
already
struggling
with
the
issue
of
trust
when
it
comes
to
heeding
recommendations
flashing
on
a
computer
screen

people
more
often
find
it
more
comforting
to
work
with
a
doctor
than
a
machine
when
dealing
with
their
health
issues
.
these
algorithms
are
also
very
complicated
and
are
hard
for
doctors
to
understand
,
so
knowing
when
something
is
going
wrong
is
a
challenge
to
recognize
and
correct
.
considering
the
gray
areas
of
assessing
medical
situations
,
morality
issues
,
and
overall
complexity
of
the
algorithms
,
it
is
hard
to
picture
a
world
where
healthcare
is
primarily
driven
by
artificial
intelligence
.
however
,
the
access
and
retrieval
of
data
that
artificial
intelligence
is
able
to
provide
for
medical
information
is
very
innovative
in
the
field
and
is
something
that
we
should
continue
to
enhance
.
there
are
many
ways
that
artificial
intelligence
is
and
can
be
beneficial
in
the
medical
field
,
however
,
keeping
boundaries
in
mind
is
very
crucial
as
it
becomes
more
and
more
evident
in
the
world
and
the
field
.
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
world
evolves
and
how
artificial
intelligence
will
play
a
role
in
health
fields
and
all
other
forms
of
industry
