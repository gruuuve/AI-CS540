ai
in
education
in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
,
a
big
aspect
of
the
paper
addresses
the
ethical
and
moral
obligations
ai
researchers
have
in
finding
ways
to
further
improve
society
.
the
report
expresses
the
notion
that
we
are
approaching
a
point
in
many
fields
of
ai
development
and
their
integration
into
human
life
in
which
the
main
question
is
not
``
how
can
be
done
?
''
but
instead
``
should
it
be
done
?
''
.
at
the
pace
in
which
ai
research
is
accelerating
and
the
promising
possibilities
it
can
provide
,
it
seems
as
if
these
researchers
are
overlooking
whether
or
not
ai
is
necessary
in
some
aspects
of
our
lives
.
the
last
two
sections
discuss
how
ai
is
improving
our
lives
today
and
what
we
can
expect
to
happen
in
the
near
future
.
despite
the
impressive
capabilities
and
potential
,
i
think
the
paper
fails
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
the
human
element
that
can
not
be
replicated
.
the
standing
committee
comment
on
the
growth
of
artificial
intelligence
over
the
past
five
years
and
predict
the
role
ai
will
have
in
a
typical
north
american
city
in
2030
as
well
as
provide
insight
into
how
and
what
fields
of
ai
will
advance
in
the
future
.
the
report
touches
on
numerous
domains
of
society
that
they
deemed
most
important
in
the
growth
of
ai
.
one
that
stood
out
to
me
was
education
and
the
development
of
teaching
robots
.
the
report
discusses
robots
such
as
the
ozobot
--
a
robot
that
teaches
children
code
and
deductive
reasoning
--
and
the
cubelets
--
a
way
to
teach
children
logical
thinking
through
assembling
robot
blocks
--
and
many
other
ways
advanced
robotics
has
weaved
its
way
into
education
.
although
the
paper
does
claim
that
``
quality
education
will
always
require
active
engagement
by
human
teachers
''
,
the
problem
here
is
that
,
at
least
in
north
america
,
there
is
already
a
shortage
in
teaching
positions
.
as
the
paper
claims
,
there
will
be
many
areas
in
which
ai
will
take
over
jobs
as
technological
advances
continue
to
grow
.
with
ai
breaking
grounds
into
education
,
there
should
be
concern
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
face
time
a
student
will
be
able
to
get
with
a
teacher
in
the
future
.
the
fact
that
teachers
in
higher
education
have
multiplied
the
size
of
their
classrooms
is
a
dual
edged
sword
and
should
be
appreciated
with
some
hesitancy
.
there
is
not
only
the
possibility
that
the
number
of
teachers
around
the
world
will
continue
to
plummet
,
but
the
exposure
students
will
be
getting
with
their
teachers
will
as
well
and
i
believe
that
can
have
significant
impact
on
the
way
we
learn
and
develop
during
such
crucial
years
of
our
lives
.
while
i
do
believe
that
they
did
not
provide
enough
insight
into
the
importance
of
a
human
touch
in
education
,
i
am
not
claiming
that
the
advances
of
ai
in
education
will
not
be
beneficial
at
all
in
the
educational
development
of
our
youth
.
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
the
importance
of
putting
a
name
to
a
face
and
i
am
certain
there
is
research
behind
the
cognitive
developmental
benefits
to
learning
from
a
fluid
intimate
environment
with
a
teacher
as
opposed
to
a
much
more
systematic
and
robust
one
with
a
robot
.
