this
world
is
surrounded
by
technology
.
smartphones
in
everyone
's
pockets
,
computers
in
everyone
's
homes
.
underneath
the
flashy
and
marketable
functionality
of
today
's
prominent
devices
lies
one
hidden
classification
:
``
artificial
intelligence
.
''
not
many
people
are
aware
of
what
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
exactly
means
,
and
what
its
future
impacts
may
be
.
that
's
what
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
and
its
report
from
2016
seek
to
explain
.
however
,
among
this
fifty-page
document
are
some
points
that
can
be
challenged
.
the
two
points
that
will
be
challenged
are
that
the
fictional
portrayal
of
ai
is
harmful
and
that
a
precise
definition
for
ai
does
not
yet
exist
.
several
times
throughout
the
report
,
it
criticizes
the
depiction
of
ai
in
movies
,
television
,
and
other
fictional
media
.
it
's
even
one
of
the
first
things
you
read
,
being
the
very
first
sentence
of
the
report
overview
.
it
tries
to
hammer
home
the
idea
that
ai
in
fiction
is
utterly
wrong
and
should
not
be
listened
to
.
i
strongly
believe
that
this
idea
should
be
changed
.
firstly
because
the
report
seems
to
contradict
itself
.
the
authors
write
that
the
idea
of
harmful
superhuman
robots
is
unrealistic
,
yet
later
state
that
``
it
will
be
possible
for
people
to
use
ai-based
systems
for
harmful
as
well
as
helpful
purposes
.
''
they
acknowledge
the
possible
abuse
of
ai
.
secondly
,
the
portrayal
of
ai
in
popular
culture
is
not
always
negative
and
is
worth
listening
to
.
there
do
exist
pro-ai
movies
,
documentaries
,
and
more
.
the
report
later
mentions
how
ai
must
be
introduced
to
the
public
in
a
way
that
creates
a
warm
welcome
.
what
better
way
to
create
a
warm
welcome
through
the
creation
of
realistic
ai
movies\/media
showcasing
the
astounding
and
limitless
possibilities
of
ai
.
simply
just
shutting
out
all
fictional
representations
closes
off
many
opportunities
for
a
better
outlook
towards
ai
.
another
point
the
article
makes
is
that
portraying
ai
is
difficult
because
there
is
no
precise
definition
of
ai
.
i
believe
ai
does
have
its
own
definition
.
they
even
give
many
good
definitions
at
several
points
in
the
report
.
it
seems
a
general
definition
is
somewhere
along
the
lines
of
``
technology
creating
value
for
human
lives
.
''
the
report
also
expresses
that
it
's
``
lack
''
of
a
universal
definition
creates
public
uneasiness
for
ai
in
their
lives
because
of
how
ai
is
represented
in
popular
culture
.
as
stated
before
,
popular
culture
should
instead
be
used
to
show
and
define
ai
for
the
public
.
if
people
have
a
better
knowledge
of
ai
,
people
will
welcome
it
with
open
arms
.
creating
trust
towards
ai
will
be
key
for
its
development
since
many
advances
in
ai
are
hindered
by
its
worrying
consequences
.
for
example
,
when
speaking
about
ai
in
healthcare
,
the
report
says
ai
could
``
improve
health
outcomes
and
quality
of
life
for
millions
...
but
only
if
they
gain
the
trust
of
doctors
,
nurses
,
and
patients
.
