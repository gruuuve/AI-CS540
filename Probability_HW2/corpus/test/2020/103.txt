the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
described
many
ways
in
which
autonomous
vehicles
would
develop
and
influence
our
lives
.
while
most
of
these
claims
seem
reasonable
,
some
could
do
with
major
reconsideration
.
one
bold
claim
made
by
the
report
was
that
ride-sharing
and
delivery
services
would
adopt
self-driving
cars
by
around
2020
.
although
we
are
currently
in
the
year
of
2020
,
that
idea
remains
just
an
idea
.
what
the
report
did
not
consider
when
making
this
claim
was
the
necessary
transformation
of
people
's
trust
in
self-driving
vehicles
.
the
only
way
for
self-driving
technology
to
actually
gain
public
trust
is
for
it
to
demonstrate
extreme
safety
and
efficiency
in
its
functionality
.
although
self-driving
technology
has
improved
since
2016
,
it
is
still
not
capable
of
demonstrating
sufficiently
high
levels
of
safety
and
efficiency
today
.
therefore
,
self-driving
vehicles
can
not
presently
be
trusted
alone
on
the
motorway
.
the
same
obstacles
that
have
prevented
fully
autonomous
vehicles
from
being
rolled
out
in
the
past
will
persist
in
the
near
future
.
self-driving
vehicles
will
require
significant
development
if
they
are
to
dominate
the
streets
in
the
near
future
.
furthermore
,
governments
are
extremely
unlikely
to
allow
commercial
sale
of
fully
autonomous
vehicles
before
deciding
who
would
bear
the
responsibility
for
any
accidents
involving
one
or
more
autonomous
vehicles
.
laws
would
need
to
be
created
for
the
handling
of
such
accidents
,
and
given
most
governments
'
lack
of
technological
expertise
,
they
would
need
to
hire
experts
to
help
them
formulate
such
laws
.
moreover
,
unless
these
laws
are
fair
,
they
are
likely
to
face
strong
opposition
from
either
autonomous
car
manufacturers
or
the
general
public
.
hiring
technological
experts
and
forming
laws
based
on
technology
takes
time
and
money
.
regardless
of
the
details
of
these
laws
,
it
would
be
useful
to
have
every
autonomous
vehicle
contain
a
black
box
or
a
dash
cam
to
provide
important
information
during
the
investigation
of
accidents
involving
those
vehicles
.
allowing
these
vehicles
on
motorways
without
proper
regulation
would
be
a
rash
move
by
the
government
.
another
flawed
idea
the
report
states
is
that
``
as
cars
will
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
city
dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
.
''
people
own
many
cars
as
a
status
symbol
more
than
as
a
requirement
.
this
will
not
change
in
the
future
,
unless
society
itself
moves
away
from
its
capitalist
nature
.
just
as
they
are
today
,
cars
in
the
future
will
be
designed
and
priced
according
to
different
income
segments
of
the
population
.
the
only
difference
is
that
most
of
the
cars
will
be
autonomous
in
the
future
.
cars
in
the
future
will
continue
to
serve
the
same
purposes
as
they
do
today
,
and
people
will
continue
to
own
different
cars
for
different
purposes
such
as
going
to
work
,
going
to
parties
,
traveling
with
family
etc.
.
the
report
also
claims
that
the
need
for
parking
will
reduce
in
the
future
,
which
will
then
affect
the
way
in
which
cities
are
planned
.
however
,
since
the
ownership
of
cars
is
unlikely
to
reduce
in
the
future
,
the
need
for
parking
space
in
cities
is
unlikely
to
reduce
as
well
.
although
other
aspects
of
artificial
intelligence
might
influence
urban
planning
in
the
future
,
the
widespread
adoption
of
autonomous
vehicles
is
unlikely
to
play
any
role
in
that
.
