the
challenge
about
ai
to
low
resource
community
and
about
solutions
that
address
concerns
towards
gaps
of
wealth
the
report
by
stone
et
al
.
has
given
the
audience
the
overall
outline
of
the
ai
development
.
to
be
honest
,
it
is
a
very
demonstrating
and
well-organized
report
about
the
concerns
and
benefits
that
ai
has
brought
or
will
bring
to
the
society
.
however
,
there
are
two
arguments
in
the
report
that
i
can
hardly
agree
with
.
while
the
authors
believe
the
ai
technology
is
beneficial
to
low
resource
community
,
i
challenge
this
idea
that
i
think
it
is
too
early
to
claim
that
ai
will
benefit
the
poor
areas
.
while
the
authors
think
of
three
policy
to
reduce
the
concerns
about
ai
to
the
gap
of
wealth
,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
work
as
solutions
.
in
fact
,
the
challenges
to
two
arguments
are
about
the
same
topic
:
the
economic
aftermath
of
artificial
intelligence
on
the
poor
.
the
authors
indicate
that
low
resource
community
will
gain
better
conditions
by
ai
technology
because
ai
can
help
the
government
to
use
their
limited
budget
efficiently
,
help
the
society
to
allocate
over-sufficient
resource
to
poor
areas
,
and
help
to
spread
the
medical
information
to
large
population
.
these
arguments
themselves
are
practical
and
undeniable
,
but
the
authors
only
think
of
the
benefit
of
resource
allocation
.
they
failed
to
point
out
the
possible
economic
challenges
that
ai
brings
to
the
low
resource
society
.
without
money
in
their
hands
,
the
poor
are
not
able
to
improve
the
conditions
by
their
owns
.
the
money
comes
with
salary
,
and
the
salary
comes
from
employment
.
even
the
authors
have
mentioned
the
potential
threats
of
joblessness
,
they
did
not
take
seriousness
of
the
joblessness
'
consequence
to
poor
areas
.
as
to
the
authors
'
argument
about
ai
's
effect
on
employment
and
jobs
,
they
claimed
that
ai
will
gradually
replace
human
's
labor
in
many
different
places
and
will
set
a
harder
standard
for
job
's
opportunities
.
dirican
(2015)
writes
that
artificial
intelligence
could
improve
the
efficiency
of
productions
but
at
the
same
time
lead
the
unemployment
of
low
skilled
workers
.
dircan
further
predicted
that
many
economic
exponents
such
as
gdp
and
philips
curve
will
change
significantly
when
the
time
of
ai
comes
.
thus
,
the
possible
consequence
of
massive
uses
of
ai
is
that
only
elites
could
gain
the
chances
to
work
and
accumulate
their
wealth
,
but
the
poor
can
only
survive
under
the
help
of
``
resource
reallocation
''
.
maybe
the
total
wealth
of
the
low-resource
community
will
shrink
and
the
wealth
difference
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
will
be
enlarged
by
the
uses
of
ais
.
the
authors
think
that
the
potential
gaps
of
wealth
increased
by
ai
could
be
reduced
by
enforcing
three
policies
:
increase
the
number
of
technical
experts
in
ai
that
the
government
has
,
reduce
impediments
to
research
on
the
social
impacts
of
ai
systems
,
and
spread
public
and
private
social
knowledge
of
the
societal
impacts
of
ai
.
however
,
these
policies
are
not
specific
enough
to
address
the
practical
concerns
.
for
example
,
the
second
policy
is
not
a
solution
at
all
.
the
reduction
of
barriers
only
provides
a
good
environment
for
experiment
,
but
this
does
not
guarantee
the
results
of
the
experiments
.
it
is
not
logical
to
say
that
we
can
get
the
results
we
expect
because
of
the
improvement
of
laws
'
environment
.
thus
,
the
authors
do
not
convince
me
in
the
possible
solutions
to
eliminate
the
gaps
of
wealth
or
economic
inequality
brought
by
ai
.
in
conclusion
,
the
arguments
in
the
report
do
not
reduce
my
concerns
about
the
economic
consequence
to
the
low-resource
community
or
poor
people
who
live
there
.
we
should
be
more
careful
and
cautious
when
applying
ai
to
our
life
.
