challenges
to
the
``
2016
stanford
report
''
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
is
a
program
to
investigate
the
development
and
impact
of
ai
.
the
study
panel
gives
a
report
on
the
progress
of
artificial
intelligence
every
five
years
.
this
essay
will
address
on
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
-lrb-
stanford
2016
report
-rrb-
.
though
being
a
thorough
analysis
of
artificial
intelligence
's
application
and
influences
in
various
domains
like
transportation
,
home\/service
robots
,
healthcare
,
and
education
,
the
stanford
2016
report
has
many
arguments
that
are
disputable
.
particularly
,
i
disagree
with
the
definition
of
artificial
intelligence
claimed
in
the
preface
,
and
the
claim
that
ai
has
no
imminent
threat
to
humans
.
in
the
stanford
2016
report
,
artificial
intelligence
is
simply
defined
as
a
set
of
``
computational
technologies
''
which
is
different
from
my
understanding
of
ai
.
in
the
report
,
even
a
calculator
is
counted
as
an
artificial
intelligence
.
it
seems
that
the
report
intentionally
gives
a
very
vague
definition
of
ai
to
include
as
many
subjects
as
possible
.
however
i
believe
for
most
of
the
people
including
me
,
artificial
intelligence
means
something
a
lot
more
intelligent
than
a
calculator
.
it
has
to
have
the
characteristics
including
but
not
limited
to
cognitive
ability
,
the
ability
to
learn
and
think
,
and
have
a
self
awareness
.
the
ai
discussed
in
the
2016
stanford
report
has
strong
limits
:
they
are
restricted
to
very
particular
fields
and
each
requires
long
time
research
.
the
research
outcome
of
them
are
relatively
independent
to
each
other
.
the
definition
of
artificial
intelligence
for
the
vast
majorities
of
us
should
be
something
that
is
once
developed
,
then
it
can
learn
things
from
all
different
fields
by
itself
.
in
high
school
,
me
myself
was
the
leader
of
a
club
named
artificial
intelligence
.
it
was
the
largest
club
in
school
,
and
we
mainly
doing
arduino
,
some
group
projects
and
robotics
,
which
includes
computer
vision
.
though
some
of
the
projects
contains
technologies
like
cnn
and
ml
,
most
of
them
are
pretty
much
unrelated
to
ai
in
a
real
sense
.
when
new
members
asking
me
why
the
club
is
called
artificial
intelligence
,
but
have
little
to
do
with
it
.
i
have
thought
about
telling
them
that
everything
we
were
doing
can
be
counted
as
artificial
intelligence
,
but
always
ended
up
explaining
in
other
ways
,
because
artificial
intelligence
to
me
is
a
supreme
subject
in
computer
science
.
no
matter
how
it
is
defined
in
this
report
or
this
class
,
the
artificial
intelligence
we
are
learning
now
shall
be
a
foundation
for
future
pursue
of
artificial
intelligence
that
is
defined
as
a
truly
intelligent
and
conscious
program
.
in
the
stanford
2016
report
,
it
is
claimed
that
artificial
intelligence
is
not
an
imminent
threat
to
mankind
,
whereas
i
do
n't
agree
.
the
report
analyzed
the
threat
through
the
lens
of
computer
consciousness
,
but
ignores
the
job
replacement
brought
by
ai
.
as
ai
is
defined
in
this
report
the
computer-controlled
automations
and
most
of
the
computer
programs
are
counted
as
ai
.
we
can
now
clearly
see
the
inevitable
trend
of
ai
expansion
:
tens
of
millions
of
people
has
lost
their
job
and
being
replaced
by
machines
controlled
by
ai
.
more
jobs
are
vanishing
in
the
future
.
two
oxford
economists
estimated
that
47
percent
of
all
u.s.
jobs
were
at
risk
of
computerization

.
if
there
the
unemployment
rate
comes
to
30
or
even
40
%
,
then
the
economy
,
as
we
've
traditionally
structured
will
definitely
collapse
.
the
vast
number
of
unemployed
and
their
demand
of
living
necessities
will
put
huge
pressure
on
the
government
,
and
certainly
is
a
threat
to
the
whole
society
.
the
2016
stanford
report
offers
thorough
analysis
of
ai
in
different
fields
.
despite
learning
a
lot
from
it
,
i
challenge
its
definition
of
artificial
intelligence
,
and
the
claim
that
ai
has
no
imminent
threat
to
humans
.
