``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
is
an
academic
study
published
for
the
purpose
of
assessing
the
development
of
ai
over
the
past
decades
while
speculating
on
the
future
impact
of
the
technology
on
relevant
industries
.
it
does
its
best
to
paint
a
picture
of
the
world
of
ai
a
decade
from
now
.
however
,
there
are
points
discussed
in
the
report
that
do
not
take
into
consideration
arguments
previously
committed
in
other
sections
.
in
particular
,
the
current
boom
in
educational
benefits
from
ai
has
been
skewed
in
a
way
that
suggests
further
growth
without
consequence
.
this
essay
seeks
to
challenge
the
report
's
predictions
about
the
future
of
ai
and
its
impact
on
early
childhood
and
secondary
education
.
it
is
important
to
outline
a
common
theme
that
is
represented
throughout
the
report
:
modern
ai
advancements
have
been
made
in
the
machine
learning
space
,
and
are
bolstered
by
improvements
in
data
gathering
and
analytics
.
this
is
an
issue
when
talking
about
childhood
development
.
the
report
depicts
the
ability
of
future
ai
to
provide
customizable
experiences
for
students
while
maintaining
a
scalable
infrastructure
that
is
accessible
for
the
masses
.
the
problem
with
ai
and
machine
learning
is
that
the
data
used
to
fuel
these
lofty
goals
will
need
to
come
from
a
source
that
is
heavily
regulated
for
justified
privacy
reasons
.
the
report
successfully
mentions
this
issue
when
covering
the
use
of
ai
in
the
health
industry
;
how
advancements
have
been
slow
to
make
it
through
fda
and
hipaa
regulations
.
there
is
an
argument
to
be
had
that
the
data
collected
to
enable
ai
in
the
early
childhood
education
field
will
also
begin
to
face
similar
opposition
in
policy
and
regulatory
actions
.
consider
a
situation
where
an
ai
is
able
to
read
a
students
homework
and
provide
feedback
that
helps
the
student
in
struggling
areas
.
that
ai
would
need
to
learn
from
the
student
's
past
experiences
and
store
it
in
an
accessible
location
.
now
as
that
information
is
scaled
up
to
hundreds
or
thousands
of
students
,
a
simple
data
leak
on
a
particular
school
would
cause
a
flurry
of
liabilities
for
all
parties
involved
.
judging
from
past
company
leaks
,
a
situation
like
this
is
not
unreasonable
.
but
even
if
security
manages
to
stay
type
for
data
used
,
there
still
comes
into
question
the
practicality
of
some
of
the
uses
mentioned
in
the
report
.
another
big
prediction
made
in
the
report
is
the
interactivity
that
ai
will
have
with
students
and
other
technologies
such
as
vr
.
while
the
vr
industry
is
certainly
promising
,
it
's
primary
limitation
is
its
poor
scalability
in
academic
environments
.
students
would
need
to
purchase
,
or
share
school
purchased
expensive
equipment
in
order
to
participate
in
coursework
,
which
is
what
ai
and
online
learning
is
looking
to
eliminate
.
the
benefits
found
in
the
collaboration
of
these
technologies
is
simply
not
scalable
for
large
participants
.
