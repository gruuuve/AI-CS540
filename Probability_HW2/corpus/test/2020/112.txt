potental
issues
for
autonomous
cars
that
are
supported
by
ai
technologies
artificial
intelligence
has
become
a
trend
to
the
world
,
however
,
there
are
more
and
more
potential
issues
about
ai
associated
industries
with
the
development
of
ai
technologies
.
in
the
paper
,
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
that
is
published
in
september
2016
,
it
is
briefly
describing
the
basic
knowledge
of
ai
and
some
associated
industries
of
ai
.
there
is
no
doubt
that
ai
is
a
trend
of
the
future
,
but
it
also
needs
huge
efforts
from
different
fields
and
a
long
time
for
people
to
adapt
its
changes
.
one
of
the
most
significant
topics
is
the
autonomous
car
,
because
it
will
cause
huge
changes
to
the
traditional
transportation
industry
and
many
controversial
ethical
problems
for
people
.
ai
technologies
have
brought
many
benefits
to
the
smart
car
,
such
as
the
gps
,
the
parking
assist
system
,
the
blind
spot
monitoring
,
and
lane
changing
alarm
.
however
,
the
industry
of
self-driving
vehicles
is
still
a
controversial
topic
.
the
transportation
industry
is
one
of
the
most
traditional
industries
in
the
world
,
it
has
affected
the
construction
and
planning
of
road
.
it
has
more
than
a
hundred
years
of
construction
and
development
,
most
of
the
current
road
and
traffic
planning
is
based
on
human-driving
vehicles
.
it
is
easier
for
autonomous
cars
to
drive
on
the
highway
or
some
wide
roads
that
have
clear
road
signs
with
the
help
of
sensing
technologies
,
but
most
of
the
city
traffic
and
some
remote
roads
have
very
complicated
road
information
and
unpredictable
situations
,
which
will
cause
many
troubles
for
ai
technologies
to
detect
and
handle
those
situations
.
to
avoid
the
accidents
and
the
chance
of
survival
depends
on
how
fast
the
ai
can
respond
to
those
unpredictable
situations
and
the
government
how
to
improve
and
support
traffic
system
and
road
signs
for
the
self-driving
car
,
whcih
also
would
be
a
difficult
and
long-time
question
.
on
the
other
hand
,
autonomous
cars
will
replace
many
jobs
and
according
to
the
paper
,
new
jobs
that
create
by
ai
programs
will
be
difficult
to
compare
with
the
current
existing
jobs
that
might
be
lost

the
driver
has
been
a
long-time-existing
job
and
there
is
a
large
number
of
people
who
make
a
living
by
it
,
and
most
of
them
are
lacking
of
the
other
professional
skills
to
find
new
jobs
,
which
meaning
they
need
to
retrain
some
new
skills
and
find
new
jobs
to
make
a
living
.
besides
,
different
people
have
different
usages
and
feelings
for
a
car
,
some
people
just
consider
it
as
a
transportation
tool
,
and
some
are
the
fancy
of
driving
cars
.
the
biggest
difference
between
autonomous
cars
and
human-driving
cars
is
one
is
based
on
ai
technologies
and
another
is
based
on
human
,
so
it
is
another
controversial
topic
to
handle
the
situations
when
two
kinds
of
cars
are
both
driving
on
the
road
when
some
accidences
happen
.
according
to
the
paper
,
there
is
still
no
clear
law
to
address
the
responsibility
and
assignment
of
blame
for
an
accident
for
self-driving
and
semi-self-driving
cars

.
if
some
people
just
do
not
accept
autonomous
cars
and
insist
to
drive
by
themselves
,
the
government
needs
to
concern
more
human
driving
factors
rather
than
just
to
adapt
the
sensors
and
ai
technologies
when
constructing
the
traffic
system
.
so
,
it
may
take
generations
of
people
to
accept
and
adapt
the
acknowledge
of
self-driving
cars
,
and
also
need
more
law
and
standards
to
address
the
responsibility
for
a
traffic
accident
.
there
are
many
issues
and
problems
that
need
to
overcome
before
the
popularization
of
the
autonomous
car
,
and
also
ai
technologies
,
this
is
exactly
the
difficulties
of
the
innovation
.
however
,
transportation
industries
and
people
will
innovate
and
adapt
to
the
new
trend
,
and
eventually
,
ai
technologies
will
bring
more
benefits
and
convenience
to
the
world
.
