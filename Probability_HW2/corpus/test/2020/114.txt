with
every
people
,
ai
is
such
a
familiar
word
because
it
exists
a
lot
in
films
,
series
.
personally
,
i
was
really
afraid
of
ai
since
the
affection
from
media
but
by
the
time
i
realize
that
ai
is
being
used
and
applied
to
our
daily
life
.
i
am
a
really
lazy
man
,
so
that
i
want
to
know
more
about
ai
and
applied
it
to
my
home
,
to
make
my
life
becomes
more
convenient
.
i
was
born
in
the
technology
era
,
internet
,
media
,
films
had
so
much
affection
for
my
generation
.
as
a
great
production
of
technology
,
ai
has
been
such
hot
content
for
filming
.
i
can
name
out
films
,
series
that
everyone
would
know
because
they
are
too
popular
like
terminator
,
stars
war
or
chappie
.
however
,
which
are
shown
about
the
ai
through
the
screen
are
usually
pretty
bad
;
films
tend
to
focus
on
how
the
ai
can
grow
in
the
future
and
be
dangerous
for
humans
.
in
fact
,
ai
is
being
used
in
our
daily
life
and
helping
our
life
become
better
.
we
can
easily
find
ai
technology
in
our
daily
life
from
the
smallest
things
to
the
greatest
things
like
mobile
apps
,
vacuum
cleaners
or
google
search
.
and
i
personally
really
interested
in
the
home
ai
machine
,
which
can
help
me
be
lazy
at
my
own
house
.
ai
or
artificial
intelligent
,
which
means
that
it
is
not
really
intelligent
and
we
have
to
teach
and
give
machine
intelligence
.
and
the
way
we
teach
the
machine
is
through
programs
that
provide
sets
of
simple
instructions
step
by
step
so
the
machine
can
understand
.
ex
:
if
i
want
to
ask
my
machine
to
take
the
cake
from
the
fridge
and
the
machine
only
knows
open
and
take
,
i
have
to
give
it
instructions
of
open
the
fridge
then
take
the
cake
through
the
program
.
normally
,
a
program
has
lots
of
codes
;
besides
that
,
it
also
contains
math
and
algorithms
which
help
the
machine
run
exactly
like
what
we
want
it
is
and
give
the
highest
accuracy
results
.
math
and
algorithms
are
important
because
the
program
is
used
to
process
complex
works
,
which
contain
many
steps
;
if
one
step
wrongs
,
everything
goes
wrong
and
we
have
to
find
and
fix
errors
since
the
machine
does
not
have
the
intelligence
itself
.
so
that
,
for
me
,
learning
ai
is
important
in
learning
how
the
logic
and
the
algorithm
go
.
from
those
,
i
improve
my
logical
thinking
which
is
necessary
for
every
programmer
.
moreover
,
learning
mathematics
is
also
my
goal
since
the
different
programs
will
require
different
formulas
.
the
more
i
know
about
math
,
the
faster
i
can
figure
out
the
solution
for
my
program
.
