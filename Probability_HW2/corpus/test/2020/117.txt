after
reading
the
report
,
i
agree
with
most
of
the
content
it
put
forward
.
but
there
are
still
some
points
that
i
think
differently
.
the
first
point
i
want
to
challenge
is
the
topic
put
forward
in
the
page
21
``
as
cars
will
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
city-dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
,
live
further
from
work
,
and
spend
time
differently
,
leading
to
an
entirely
new
urban
organization
.
''
to
begin
with
,
it
could
be
understood
that
with
the
technology
of
ai
reaching
a
certain
stage
that
self
-
driving
is
safer
than
human
driving
.
people
would
refuse
to
drive
themselves
because
it
is
more
labor
saving
and
safer
.
however
,
i
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
decline
of
car
quantities
in
the
world
.
from
my
perspective
,
people
eager
to
own
cars
themselves
for
they
prefer
the
cars
'
maneuverability
and
the
freedom
that
cars
give
to
them
.
therefore
,
the
success
in
self-driving
would
not
influence
these
two
factors
.
instead
,
city-dwellers
may
eager
to
buy
private
cars
and
experience
the
convenience
of
self-driving
themselves
.
then
,
live
further
than
urban
area
is
not
a
contemporary
tendency
.
because
of
the
booming
population
in
downtown
area
,
the
housing
price
is
unrealistic
for
most
of
dwellers
,
which
push
them
to
live
far
away
from
the
central
area
of
the
metropolis
.
also
,
according
to
the
report
,
with
help
of
self-driving
cutting
down
the
car
quantities
in
city
,
there
will
be
more
space
in
urban
area
,
which
leads
to
a
new
urban
organization
is
unrealistic
.
because
in
most
of
metropolis
,
parking
areas
for
cars
are
already
pretty
small
,
it
would
n't
make
a
big
difference
.
in
addition
,
in
this
block
.
the
report
said
``
self-driving
cars
may
also
serve
to
increase
the
freedom
and
mobility
of
different
subgroups
of
the
population
,
including
youth
,
elderly
and
disabled
.
''
from
my
perspective
,
self-driving
could
not
take
good
of
these
groups
of
population
.
i
think
what
author
wanted
to
declare
here
is
youth
,
elderly
and
disabled
people
could
not
drive
themselves
.
so
,
they
could
depend
on
self-driving
to
enhance
their
mobility
.
however
,
i
suppose
the
most
significant
problem
of
these
people
is
that
they
need
some
extra
care
like
help
to
get
on
and
off
or
babysit
onboard
.
the
second
point
i
could
not
agree
with
is
in
page
26
``
ai-based
applications
could
improve
health
outcomes
and
quality
of
life
for
millions
of
people
in
the
coming
years
--
but
only
if
they
gain
the
trust
of
doctors
,
nurses
,
and
patients
.
''
it
ca
n't
be
denied
that
some
patients
even
do
not
trust
the
doctors
when
they
seek
medical
advice
,
it
must
be
harder
for
them
to
trust
such
an
electrical
device
.
therefore
,
i
suppose
the
premise
for
ai-based
applications
to
succeed
is
not
about
these
three
kinds
of
peoples
'
attitudes
,
it
's
about
whether
the
ai-based
applications
could
diagnosis
scientifically
and
correctly
.
thus
,
i
think
we
could
use
technology
like
deep
learning
and
abundant
medical
data
to
train
the
ai-based
application
.
also
,
promote
the
use
of
automated
medical
devices
in
hospitals
so
that
application
could
get
patients
'
physical
data
without
asking
.
when
the
accuracy
rate
of
application
's
diagnosis
high
enough
,
we
could
put
it
into
use
.
when
patients
and
people
understand
what
ai-based
application
could
do
,
they
would
start
to
accept
the
ai
's
success
in
healthcare
.
lastly
,
in
the
page
29
of
the
report
``
specialized
motion
tracking
devices
...
and
the
emerging
-lrb-
inter
-rrb-
connectedness
between
the
home
environment
and
health-monitoring
devices
have
created
a
vibrant
new
sector
of
innovation
.
