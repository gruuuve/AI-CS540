my
first
disagreement
with
the
paper
is
based
on
its
general
lack
of
concern
for
possible
future
ai
catastrophes
.
as
the
report
mentions
the
form
of
ai
seen
in
popular
fiction
does
seem
unlikely
to
become
reality
in
the
next
15
years
.
but
the
authors
mention
that
their
research
did
not
delve
into
military
ai
applications
at
all
.
there
is
a
need
to
limit
the
scope
of
projects
and
this
project
already
had
a
very
large
scope
;
however
,
military
ai
and
its
development
could
have
profound
effects
in
the
next
15
years
.
the
paper
states
,
``
unlike
in
the
movies
,
there
is
no
race
of
superhuman
robots
on
the
horizon
or
probably
even
possible
.
''
as
drones
powered
by
ai
continue
to
prove
a
deadly
force
in
the
united
states
military
,
it
's
unreasonable
to
say
that
combat
ai
in
the
far
future
could
never
progress
be
just
as
impactful
as
what
is
seen
in
some
current
media
,
even
if
it
does
not
look
exactly
the
same
.
furthermore
,
their
guidelines
for
future
ai
policy
do
not
include
any
mention
of
ethical
ai
development
.
without
proper
ethical
development
guidelines
military
ai
could
be
used
for
controlling
society
or
creating
violence
on
a
level
not
currently
possible
.
my
main
disagreement
with
the
paper
stems
from
the
idea
that
giving
quality
education
will
never
be
achievable
by
future
ai
.
the
paper
states
,
``
...
quality
education
will
always
require
active
engagement
by
human
teachers
.
''
statements
similar
to
the
one
prior
are
placed
in
the
paper
multiple
times
showing
the
importance
the
authors
place
on
this
idea
.
ai
has
a
long
future
ahead
of
it
and
vague
limits
on
what
is
possible
through
ai
could
easily
change
as
it
develops
.
due
to
recent
strides
in
ai
mimicking
human
thinking
it
seems
possible
to
believe
that
ai
will
be
able
to
perform
critical
thinking
that
we
currently
believe
is
outside
of
their
capability
.
furthermore
,
as
the
paper
points
out
,
universities
have
already
begun
utilizing
ai
to
teach
students
on
a
large
scale
.
the
paper
mentions
that
a
strength
of
ai
teaching
is
its
ability
to
personalize
its
lessons
and
pace
towards
each
individual
student
.
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
personalization
that
ai
offers
will
outpace
the
current
benefits
of
human
teachers
who
will
not
be
able
to
offer
the
same
level
of
personalization
.
even
though
universities
are
the
best
example
of
how
ai
can
be
used
to
teach
students
,
as
ai
's
natural
language
processing
pushes
forward
younger
children
will
be
able
to
interact
and
learn
from
ai
.
ai
's
current
success
in
the
field
of
education
and
its
possible
future
improvements
that
ai
could
provide
a
full
education
better
than
what
is
available
today
.
in
summation
,
the
paper
limits
the
possible
future
impacts
of
ai
more
than
it
should
.
the
paper
seemingly
rules
out
the
possibility
of
ai
ever
posing
an
apocalyptic
or
society
changing
threat
in
military
scenarios
and
being
able
to
provide
a
complete
education
on
par
with
what
is
available
in
our
current
society
.
falling
short
in
considering
all
future
possibilities
with
ai
can
lead
to
shortsightedness
towards
ethics
in
current
development
.
