in
the
report
provided
,
the
authors
conclude
that
self-driving
and
remotely
controlled
delivery
vehicles
,
flying
vehicles
,
and
trucks
will
be
widely
seen
soon
with
advances
in
sensing
algorithms
-lrb-
p19
-rrb-
.
furthermore
,
the
authors
propose
several
potential
benefits
brought
by
self-driving
vehicles
,
such
as
increasing
driving
safety
and
displacing
the
need
for
public
transportation
.
however
,
the
adoption
of
self-driving
vehicles
still
faces
the
following
challenges
.
the
threshold
challenge
is
that
,
it
is
unlikely
that
self-driving
vehicles
are
going
to
ever
achieve
perfect
accuracy
under
all
conditions
in
spite
of
many
advances
so
far
.
all
self-driving
systems
make
decision
based
on
the
perception
of
the
environment
and
predefined
traffic
rules
-lrb-
sivak
and
schoettle
,
2015a
-rrb-
.
however
,
there
has
been
occasional
failures
of
these
systems
when
they
have
encountered
scenarios
that
were
hitherto
unseen
-lrb-
kang
et
al.
,
2018
-rrb-
.
for
example
,
in
poor
weather
conditions
or
due
to
traffic
light
malfunctions
,
the
sensors
in
self-driving
systems
may
result
in
different
cues
that
contract
each
other
,
causing
confusion
in
decision
making
process
.
in
general
,
the
real
world
situations
are
so
diverse
and
unpredictable
,
that
there
are
always
situations
that
can
not
be
matched
with
predefined
rules
and
may
occasionally
lead
to
self-driving
system
failures
.
human
factor
issue
is
another
challenge
that
self-driving
systems
are
facing
.
for
instance
,
one
important
human
factor
that
has
not
received
sufficient
attention
is
motion
sickness
-lrb-
sivak
and
schoettle
,
2015b
-rrb-
.
motion
sickness
is
most
frequently
caused
by
a
conflict
between
visual
and
vestibular
inputs
,
loss
of
control
over
one
s
movements
,
and
reduced
ability
to
anticipate
the
direction
of
movement
-lrb-
cunningham
and
regan
,
2015
-rrb-
.
all
three
factors
are
more
frequently
experienced
by
vehicle
passengers
than
by
drivers
,
which
leads
to
the
fact
that
up
to
10
%
of
american
adults
are
expected
to
experience
motion
sickness
often
in
autonomous
vehicles
-lrb-
sivak
and
schoettle
,
2015b
-rrb-
.
to
sum
up
,
human
factor
such
as
motion
sickness
may
present
concerns
for
drivers
acceptances
of
self-driving
systems
.
in
addition
,
there
are
still
building
blocks
in
the
development
of
deep
learning
approaches
for
self-driving
systems
.
for
data
preparation
,
anomalies
in
the
dataset
such
as
traffic
accidents
,
broken
infrastructure
,
etc.
that
are
of
most
interest
but
really
hard
to
get
-lrb-
rao
and
frtunikj
,
2018
-rrb-
.
for
model
generation
,
a
specific
functional
safety
requirement
is
implemented
by
a
certain
piece
of
code
,
which
can
hardly
be
achieved
when
assessing
the
implementation
of
a
deep
learning
approach
-lrb-
koopman
and
wagner
,
2017
-rrb-
.
for
model
deployment
,
transfer
learning
is
necessary
for
self-driving
systems
since
most
of
the
models
in
today
s
deep
learning
publications
are
only
finetuned
based
on
a
well-known
pre-trained
model
-lrb-
deng
et
al
,
2009
-rrb-
.
however
,
how
many
data
is
additionally
needed
for
the
fine-tuning
and
how
should
we
verify
the
fine-tuned
network
still
remain
big
issues
for
self-driving
vehicles
-lrb-
rao
and
frtunikj
,
2018
-rrb-
.
therefore
,
dataset
completeness
,
neural
network
implementation
,
and
transfer
learning
are
still
main
concerns
in
developing
deep
learning
approaches
for
self-driving
vehicles
.
to
put
it
in
a
nutshell
,
although
the
authors
are
confident
about
the
development
of
self-driving
vehicles
using
the
technology
of
ai
,
there
are
still
several
challenges
,
such
as
decision
making
process
,
human
factor
issue
and
adoption
method
of
deep
learning
approach
,
that
need
to
be
carefully
addressed
in
the
future
