for
the
challenges
of
this
article
,
i
think
ai
should
be
an
exploration
of
human
intelligence
instead
of
machines
'
intelligence
.
in
addition
,
i
believe
that
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
applications
,
self-driving
car
technology
will
bring
higher
safety
.
before
the
challenge
,
i
asked
myself
a
question
,
what
is
artificial
intelligence
?
page
12
of
the
article
mentioned
that
artificial
intelligence
is
an
activity
dedicated
to
making
machines
intelligent
.
in
my
view
,
artificial
intelligence
is
made
up
of
two
words
:
artificial
and
intelligence
.
``
artificial
''
is
considered
to
be
an
artificial
system
in
the
ordinary
sense
.
people
will
think
about
what
things
can
be
created
by
labor
,
or
whether
people
can
create
artificial
intelligence
.
secondly
,
the
term
,
intelligence
,
involves
various
fields
,
such
as
consciousness
,
mind
,
unconscious
,
etc.
.
the
only
intellect
that
people
know
is
human
brains
.
nevertheless
,
it
is
very
limited
for
people
to
understand
human
brains
.
people
also
have
a
limited
understanding
of
the
necessary
elements
that
how
to
make
a
system
more
intelligent
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
define
what
is
intelligent
for
``
manual
manufacturing
''
.
therefore
,
i
think
the
research
on
artificial
intelligence
often
involves
the
exploration
of
human
intelligence
.
people
used
artificial
intelligence
in
their
own
lives
gradually
.
so
what
are
the
uses
of
artificial
intelligence
?
image
recognition
technology
is
one
of
the
fields
of
artificial
intelligence
research
,
and
self-driving
car
technology
belongs
to
the
category
of
artificial
intelligence
image
recognition
research
.
the
car
uses
its
internal
image
recognition
system
to
perform
road
observations
and
completes
the
purpose
of
driverless
driving
eventually
.
according
to
the
article
provided
,
with
the
popularity
of
driverless
cars
,
safety
will
become
a
major
issue
for
people
.
on
page
21
,
the
article
mentioned
that
in
different
environments
,
unmanned
vehicles
need
to
adapt
to
different
road
conditions
,
otherwise
it
will
cause
safety
problems
.
in
addition
,
hackers
will
use
program
bugs
to
compile
self-driving
vehicle
systems
,
finally
resulting
in
human
injury
or
death
.
my
challenge
to
this
view
is
i
do
n't
think
the
popularization
of
the
driverless
cars
will
bring
more
safety
issues
.
on
the
contrary
,
driverless
car
technology
will
reduce
the
occurrence
of
traffic
accidents
effectively
.
the
popularity
of
driverless
cars
can
reduce
the
harm
caused
by
distracted
driving
effectively
.
most
traffic
accidents
are
caused
by
distracted
driving
.
most
of
the
time
,
when
the
driver
is
driving
,
there
will
be
passengers
in
the
car
,
such
as
family
members
or
friends
.
when
other
people
talk
to
the
driver
in
the
car
,
it
causes
the
driver
to
be
distracted
.
in
addition
to
passenger
factors
,
mobile
phones
can
also
be
a
cause
of
distraction
for
drivers
.
when
drivers
use
their
mobile
phones
to
navigate
or
make
phone
calls
,
their
attention
is
distracted
.
if
there
is
a
child
cry
,
it
will
directly
affect
the
driver
's
mood
.
when
drivers
are
distracted
or
impatient
,
traffic
accidents
can
easily
occur
.
however
,
unmanned
vehicle
technology
can
prevent
distracted
driving
,
because
it
does
not
require
people
to
drive
themselves
.
people
can
talk
or
make
phone
calls
in
the
car
without
worrying
about
traffic
accidents
,
because
the
radar
can
detect
the
surrounding
dangers
and
make
adjustments
in
time
to
deal
with
dangerous
accidents
.
of
course
,
controlling
vehicle
speed
is
necessary
since
is
the
speed
is
too
fast
,
it
will
cause
radar
judgment
to
be
biased
.
after
reading
the
article
,
i
have
a
deeper
understanding
of
ai
,
and
i
have
challenged
the
ideas
in
the
article
.
this
article
made
me
interested
in
ai
and
inspired
me
to
take
the
cs540
course
seriously
.
