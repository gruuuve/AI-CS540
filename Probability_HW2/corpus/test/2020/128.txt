in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
the
authors
'
greatest
challenge
is
to
define
what
intelligence
meant
,
not
just
for
machines
but
for
us
as
humans
as
well
.
adding
on
to
that
challenge
there
exists
difficulty
in
the
general
public
's
perception
of
ai
,
which
is
not
very
positive
and
can
be
largely
attributed
to
science
fiction
entertainment
,
and
how
to
change
that
perception
to
be
a
positive
and
safe
view
of
ai
.
the
field
of
ai
is
not
meant
to
create
a
machine
to
surpass
human
abilities
in
every
way
,
but
rather
to
make
our
lives
easier
,
safer
,
and
faster
.
in
the
near
future
we
could
be
seeing
autonomous
vehicles
everywhere
,
meaning
that
there
would
be
significantly
less
traffic
and
less
accidents
.
people
will
be
able
to
spend
more
time
on
other
things
as
the
author
had
mentioned
in
the
report
as
the
advances
in
things
like
computer
vision
is
contributing
greatly
to
the
near
possibility
of
having
self
driving
vehicles
all
over
major
cities
.
the
author
thinks
that
these
advances
will
come
by
2030
.
i
disagree
with
the
authors
view
in
this
way
as
i
think
it
will
be
much
longer
before
we
see
ai
implemented
like
this
in
our
every
day
life
.
i
think
it
will
be
much
longer
before
we
see
this
,
and
not
only
that
but
i
think
the
public
's
perception
on
ai
will
take
much
longer
to
change
.
the
next
generation
with
humans
that
are
raised
with
ai
implementation
will
be
the
first
to
accept
without
thought
about
what
ai
does
for
us
and
how
it
works
.
but
more
advances
like
these
are
being
made
in
other
fields
including
home
service
,
healthcare
,
education
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
and
security
,
and
entertainment
.
the
biggest
issue
with
the
acceptance
among
the
general
public
seems
to
be
that
the
result
of
the
rapid
advancement
of
ai
is
that
many
jobs
will
be
replaced
.
there
have
already
been
many
factory
jobs
replaced
by
machines
,
leaving
many
workers
unemployed
.
in
the
near
term
,
the
author
believes
that
ai
will
replace
skills
rather
than
jobs
.
when
jobs
are
replaced
,
new
jobs
are
created
.
however
,
new
jobs
that
would
be
created
in
this
instance
would
require
a
higher
education
level
as
the
technology
gets
more
advanced
.
ai
is
also
expected
to
lower
the
prices
of
goods
and
services
as
costs
become
cheaper
.
so
as
one
can
see
,
there
are
many
positives
and
negatives
with
the
implementation
of
ai
.
another
thing
to
look
at
regarding
ai
is
the
policy
governing
its
existence
and
possibilities
.
if
policy
is
created
wrongfully
,
we
could
see
the
benefits
of
ai
only
affecting
those
who
are
`
chosen
'
.
to
prevent
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
benefits
from
ai
,
the
study
offered
three
recommendations
:
defining
a
path
for
technical
expertise
in
ai
,
remove
impediments
to
research
,
and
increase
funding
public
and
privately
.
in
my
opinion
,
i
think
just
the
term
``
artificial
intelligence
''
concerns
or
scares
the
general
public
mostly
because
they
do
n't
truly
understand
what
that
means
.
i
think
that
advancements
in
ai
could
be
largely
accepted
in
the
future
if
people
working
in
the
field
give
a
better
definition
of
what
ai
is
.
it
is
not
like
we
are
giving
machines
the
power
to
think
rather
we
are
giving
machines
the
ability
to
learn
from
mistakes
to
become
more
efficient
and
successful
at
the
specific
task
they
are
being
made
to
do
.
in
reality
,
ai
is
all
around
us
and
making
our
lives
easier
in
the
current
world
,
and
in
the
future
ai
will
continue
to
improve
human
lives
all
around
the
world
.
