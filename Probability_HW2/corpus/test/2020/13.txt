in
the
report
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
,
the
author
explores
the
topic
of
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
and
its
real-world
applications
that
are
relevant
in
the
present-tense
and
the
future
.
the
author
argues
that
ai
is
not
something
that
should
be
dreaded
or
limited
but
is
something
that
should
be
accepted
so
that
it
reaches
its
full
potential
to
make
our
daily
lives
safer
,
easier
,
and
more
efficient
.
the
author
provides
a
definition
of
ai
which
says
that
ai
is
the
activity
devoted
to
making
machines
intelligent
,
and
intelligence
is
that
quality
that
enables
an
entity
to
function
appropriately
and
with
foresight
in
its
environment
.
according
to
the
author
,
this
intelligence
can
enhance
many
domains
of
our
daily
lives
.
these
domains
include
public
safety
and
security
,
employment
and
the
workplace
,
etc.
.
though
the
author
provides
many
viable
and
positive
impacts
that
ai
can
have
,
there
are
still
negative
social
costs
that
ai
can
not
account
for
.
according
to
the
report
,
ai
will
inevitably
replace
work
that
requires
skilled
labor
.
as
mentioned
in
the
report
,
replacing
human
workers
with
ai
will
decrease
the
cost
of
goods
and
services
,
which
is
said
to
improve
the
average
standard
of
living
.
the
report
mentions
that
though
working
generates
intrinsic
value
,
most
people
work
for
monetary
gain
to
afford
the
things
they
value
.
the
report
makes
it
seems
that
monetary
gain
is
more
valuable
than
the
specialized
skills
of
humans
.
most
of
these
people
have
worked
hard
to
get
where
they
are
.
some
have
dreamed
to
be
where
they
are
since
a
child
.
some
have
endured
years
of
learning
and
practice
.
to
one
day
strip
them
of
all
their
hard
work
and
take
away
their
purpose
and
what
makes
them
a
contributor
to
society
by
replacing
them
with
ai
is
dehumanizing
.
the
economic
boon
from
replacing
humans
with
ai
is
an
attractive
idea
,
however
,
this
transition
forgets
the
human
.
a
similar
case
occurs
with
ai
in
the
realm
of
public
safety
and
security
.
ai
can
be
used
to
solve
and
prevent
crime
and
terrorism
,
according
to
the
report
.
this
digital
form
of
policing
has
been
implemented
in
many
big
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
.
having
constant
surveillance
in
place
can
truly
prevent
crime
and
protect
people
from
threats
.
even
though
policing
ai
has
good
intentions
to
serve
and
protect
,
the
impact
can
be
negative
.
having
this
type
of
technology
in
law
enforcement
can
perpetuate
or
even
worsen
social
issues
such
as
racism
and
profiling
.
how
will
ai
identify
who
is
most
likely
to
be
a
criminal
?
is
it
based
on
what
a
person
looks
like
or
a
person
s
criminal
record
?
or
,
it
is
based
on
their
environment
?
if
it
is
the
case
that
a
person
is
classified
as
a
criminal
based
on
those
parameters
,
ai
will
be
built
on
human
bias
.
the
image
of
a
terrorist
or
a
criminal
to
ai
will
mirror
what
a
criminal
or
terrorist
is
from
the
eye
of
the
human
law
enforcer
.
from
the
country
s
dark
history
,
that
image
is
crafted
by
certain
racial
and
ethnic
groups
.
having
ai
do
the
job
instead
of
human
officers
will
simply
allow
the
broken
law
enforcement
system
to
do
its
job
much
faster
.
ai
at
its
full
potential
would
be
a
great
addition
to
society
.
it
would
make
the
lives
of
humans
safer
,
easier
,
and
more
efficient
.
however
,
though
ai
has
many
benefits
,
it
can
have
many
negative
impacts
on
society
by
worsening
problems
or
creating
more
.
it
is
not
until
these
issues
