the
report
proclaims
that
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
is
the
way
of
the
future
.
ai
is
going
to
make
a
positive
impact
on
various
aspects
of
our
lives
starting
from
entertainment
,
education
,
healthcare
to
transportation
,
public
safety
and
many
more
.
but
the
report
downplays
the
disadvantages
of
ai
due
to
potential
positive
long-term
outlook
.
the
report
claims
that
ai
will
invade
almost
every
employment
sector
and
mostly
instead
of
automating
the
job
itself
,
ai
will
only
automate
certain
tasks
.
the
report
also
claims
that
with
social
and
healthcare
data
,
applications
can
be
developed
that
provide
insight
into
the
health
of
an
individual
and
over
time
robots
can
perform
surgeries
.
but
potentially
,
if
ai
has
the
power
to
automate
certain
tasks
,
then
certainly
with
time
,
ai
can
be
developed
with
sufficient
intelligence
to
automate
jobs
starting
from
medium-skilled
jobs
like
driving
taxis
and
expanded
to
automate
jobs
where
majority
of
the
population
hold
.
with
political
influence
,
it
may
be
convenient
to
obtain
data
from
patients
to
develop
ai
tools
.
but
it
again
raises
the
issues
of
ethical
concerns
and
privacy
.
so
it
is
important
to
consider
the
disadvantages
caused
by
ai
so
that
steps
can
be
implemented
to
diminish
the
hazards
of
ai
.
it
is
true
that
from
the
1960
's
ai
has
been
come
a
long
way
.
thanks
to
ai
,
in
the
near
future
,
most
small-scale
tasks
of
human
beings
would
be
automated
.
autonomous
self-driving
cars
is
an
example
of
large
scale
application
of
ai
that
can
have
lots
of
benefits
like
encouraging
car
pooling
,
increasing
comfort
,
reducing
traffic
congestion
and
many
more
.
but
specifically
,
autonomous
self-driving
cars
also
threaten
the
job
security
of
truckers
,
taxi
drivers
,
and
potentially
pilots
.
similarly
,
with
the
help
of
ai
,
tools
and
robots
can
be
developed
that
could
potentially
lead
to
a
high
unemployment
level
.
since
the
technologies
related
to
ai
will
be
limited
to
technological
companies
,
there
can
be
an
extreme
imbalance
of
income
inequality
.
as
a
result
the
innovation
of
ai
may
be
halted
due
to
economic
reasons
.
the
public
already
fear
that
automation
is
going
to
cause
lots
of
loss
of
jobs
.
it
is
only
fair
to
determine
jobs
that
can
be
created
using
ai
to
balance
the
scale
.
as
a
result
,
ai
should
be
more
focused
on
improving
the
gradual
overall
living
for
all
humans
while
causing
minimal
damage
.
the
report
also
claims
that
in
the
healthcare
sector
,
using
data
from
patients
-lrb-
like
history
of
health
illness
-rrb-
,
we
can
develop
applications
to
better
assist
patients
and
more
data
we
obtain
from
the
patient
,
the
better
services
and
tools
we
can
build
and
deploy
for
them
.
but
many
patients
are
hesitant
to
hand
out
sensitive
data
so
we
are
limited
by
lack
of
information
to
think
creatively
and
develop
tools
using
ai
.
the
government
can
potentially
pass
laws
that
makes
sure
developers
have
sufficient
information
to
develop
applications
.
but
generally
,
the
public
wo
n't
take
well
to
such
laws
.
gradually
in
the
near
future
,
if
robots
have
been
developed
that
can
perform
surgeries
,
it
will
take
extremely
long
time
to
standardize
the
norm
because
patients
would
n't
prefer
a
machine
to
perform
life-saving
surgeries
on
them
.
