the
report
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
is
a
very
well
written
report
that
does
a
good
job
about
providing
the
current
state
of
ai
and
what
future
developments
the
world
could
see
and
benefit
from
.
one
opinion
that
is
outlined
in
the
article
is
that
ai
algorithms
are
more
``
capable
of
making
less
biased
decisions
than
a
typical
person
''
and
should
be
kept
free
of
biases
that
could
result
in
discrimination
based
on
race
,
sexual
orientation
,
or
other
factors
(10)
.
while
i
agree
that
ai
algorithms
should
be
free
of
dicrimination
,
such
as
race
or
sexual
orientation
,
i
do
n't
think
that
ai
algorithms
are
less
biased
than
a
regular
person
.
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
believe
this
,
but
the
main
reason
is
that
ai
algorithms
are
primarily
created
to
correctly
act
in
the
way
that
the
programmer
or
company
behind
them
envisions
.
let
's
take
youtube
as
an
example
.
youtube
is
a
company
that
actively
shape
their
algorithms
according
to
their
video
guidelines
.
if
youtube
outlines
that
discriminatory
content
is
anything
that
talks
about
a
group
of
people
in
bad
light
in
any
matter
and
adds
this
philosophy
to
their
algorithm
,
there
are
a
lot
of
rippling
consequences
.
this
means
that
content
like
comedic
videos
that
make
fun
of
these
groups
of
people
in
an
acceptable
fashion
or
like
informational
videos
that
talk
about
the
good
and
bad
of
these
groups
of
people
would
be
flagged
as
discriminatory
content
.
to
me
,
this
type
of
algorithm
is
just
as
discriminatory
if
not
more
discriminatory
as
a
regular
person
as
it
even
limits
the
acceptable
content
by
so
much
.
taking
this
example
further
we
run
into
even
more
problems
if
we
consider
different
viewpoints
that
companies
have
such
as
political
viewpoints
.
let
's
take
youtube
's
parent
company
google
in
this
example
.
google
is
known
to
many
as
a
very
progressive
company
that
carries
a
lot
of
liberal
values
.
when
google
codes
their
search
algorithms
,
they
have
a
very
liberal
mindset
attached
to
it
.
what
does
that
mean
if
they
code
a
search
algorithm
to
match
this
viewpoint
?
it
means
that
everything
that
is
searched
will
have
that
same
liberal
lense
attached
to
it
.
it
means
that
topics
that
you
expect
to
be
fairly
non-controversial
could
suddenly
result
in
largely
negative
or
positive
search
results
.
it
could
also
mean
topics
that
are
controversial
resulting
in
largely
non-controversial
searches
.
this
type
of
behavior
would
not
be
tolerated
in
a
predominantly
politically
split
western
society
,
and
actually
causes
google
to
come
under
fire
very
frequently
.
it
just
furthers
the
belief
that
ai
algorithms
are
by
no
means
free
of
biases
.
