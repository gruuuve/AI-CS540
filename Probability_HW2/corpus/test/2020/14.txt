the

eventually
goes
on

say
that
``
the

on

is
ambiguous
,
but
labor

are
unlikely
to
benefit
everyone

,
this

does
not
accurately
portray
the
potential
risks
that
the

could
introduce

jobs
that

be

according

as
a

these

would

be

by
jobs
that
only
15
%
of
the
workers
are
qualified

while
ai
could
help
the
economy
by
eliminating
the
need
for
hourly
workers
in
many
retail
settings
,
therefore
being
likely
to
decrease
the
cost
of

,
it
could
also
be
detrimental
to
the
job
economy
of

working

though
the

study
report
claims
that
``

will
lower
the
cost
of

goods
and

making

only

director

,
carl
benedikt
frey
,
addresses
this
issue
in
a
recent
article
printed
by
the
wall
street
journal
.
in
the
article
,
frey
references
previous
technological
advancements
and
revolutions
to
point
out
that
``
...
the
coming
revolution
in
artificial
intelligence
is
likely
to
destroy
more
jobs
than
it
creates
in
the
short
run
''
.
and
,
as
touched
on
in
the
same
article
,
the
economical
benefits
may
seem
to
outweigh
the
costs
in
the
long-run
,
but
the
generation
to
benefit
from
these
advancements
is
often
not
the
same
generation
which
experiences
the
costs
of
the
revolution
.
the
class
of
workers
that
will
likely
struggle
with
unemployment
for
years
is
not
going
to
be
the
same
class
which
gains
higher
paying
jobs
or
sees
the
benefit
of
the
lowered
market
costs
.
