one
of
the
points
the
author
uses
to
support
his
point
in
how
ai
can
help
children
learn
to
code
is
with
teaching
robots
.
although
this
is
a
good
idea
,
i
do
not
believe
that
these
robots
solely
will
help
provide
enough
of
an
education
on
coding
itself
.
the
ai
may
help
make
the
content
interesting
,
but
it
may
not
fully
be
comprehensible
to
the
child
.
on
its
own
,
teaching
robots
do
not
provide
enough
of
a
way
to
teach
a
child
,
but
with
a
supervisor
,
teacher
or
parent
,
it
would
be
a
great
asset
.
the
author
does
n't
mention
in
this
section
how
ai
and
robots
can
be
used
to
supplement
education
.
the
usage
of
such
technology
may
improve
success
rates
in
students
compared
to
solely
teachers
likewise
,
robots
and
ai
on
their
own
can
not
fully
teach
a
student
.
in
this
age
,
the
combination
of
both
human
interaction
and
ai
is
the
best
way
to
teach
children
,
until
the
ai
becomes
more
sophisticated
.
the
author
goes
on
to
mention
how
ai
can
be
used
in
schools
and
colleges
,
but
due
to
lack
of
money
and
evidence
this
data
is
effective
is
withholding
the
potential
of
ai
.
however
,
one
of
the
main
points
ai
is
n't
relevant
in
many
areas
yet
is
because
there
is
not
enough
data
collected
that
can
be
used
by
the
ai
to
make
decisions
.
that
is
because
of
the
consent
to
obtain
information
.
many
ais
utilize
information
based
on
real
human
interactions
.
this
means
that
companies
have
to
request
consumers
to
legally
accept
that
they
can
use
their
information
.
that
causes
concerns
to
many
people
,
because
they
may
not
like
the
idea
that
their
actions
are
being
recorded
.
this
follows
to
another
point
the
author
made
about
privacy
on
consumers
.
while
the
technology
to
predict
future
behavior
is
there
,
it
may
not
be
accurate
enough
to
push
out
to
their
consumers
.
this
can
cause
major
problems
in
ensuring
the
proper
course
of
action
that
should
be
enacted
.
one
example
the
author
also
mentions
is
in
the
court
system
.
the
ai
may
or
may
not
choose
to
give
a
sentence
that
a
jury
or
judge
would
agree
with
to
an
extent
.
although
the
ai
can
base
their
reasons
on
the
defendant
's
previous
actions
,
it
is
not
fully
capable
of
understanding
how
decisions
are
made
as
a
human
being
,
using
emotions
and
other
outlying
reasons
.
