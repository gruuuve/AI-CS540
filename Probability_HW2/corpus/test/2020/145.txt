the
aim
of
the
one
hundred
year
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai100
-rrb-
study
is
to
provide
four
groups
,
the
general
public
,
industry
,
government
,
and
artificial
intelligence
researchers
,
with
a
greater
understanding
of
what
artificial
intelligence
is
,
its
current
state
in
the
world
,
and
the
possible
advances
in
the
future
.
specifically
,
the
study
wants
to
qualm
the
general
publics
'
current
fears
of
artificial
intelligence
spurred
by
pop-culture
sci-fi
films
that
depict
artificial
intelligence
taking
over
the
world
,
provide
industries
with
useful
information
to
help
with
resource
allocation
,
help
governments
plan
for
future
incorporation
of
artificial
intelligence
into
governance
,
and
give
insightful
considerations
to
artificial
intelligence
researchers
.
overall
,
the
ai100
achieves
their
goal
through
the
consideration
of
eight
`
domains
'
:
transportation
;
service
robots
;
healthcare
;
education
;
low-resource
communities
;
public
safety
and
security
;
employment
and
workplace
;
and
entertainment
,
providing
speculations
,
observations
,
and
current
knowledge
of
ethical
and
legal
challenges
as
well
as
the
current
implementation
of
artificial
intelligence
into
these
domains
.
within
the
study
,
the
author
claims
that
``
as
cars
will
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
city
-
dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
,
live
further
from
work
,
and
spend
time
differently
,
leading
to
an
entirely
new
urban
organization
.

however
,
the
author
vastly
undermines
the
superstitions
surrounding
artificial
intelligence
.
despite
the
attempt
to
educate
the
general
public
about
the
benefits
that
ai
already
brings
,
and
will
continue
to
bring
,
to
society
,
people
generally
get
drawn
to
stories
against
artificial
intelligence
.
for
example
,
tesla
's
cars
have
implemented
a
semi-autonomous
autopilot
feature
,
and
subsequently
have
had
to
deal
with
many
allegations
claiming
that
the
autopilot
feature
was
responsible
for
many
car
crash
related
deaths
.
here
,
the
superstitions
surrounding
artificial
intelligence
flourish
.
many
people
believe
that
the
semi-autonomous
cars
are
unsafe
and
unreliable
,
claiming
that
many
of
the
car
crashes
seem
`
similar
,
'
implicating
that
the
semi-autonomous
driving
algorithm
was
the
sole
reason
for
the
unfortunate
car
accidents
.
some
reports
even
claim
that
the
artificial
intelligence
algorithms
are
purposely
crashing
cars
.
even
if
such
acute
superstition
was
n't
present
,
i
believe
that
the
authors
claim
that
that
city-dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
,
and
liver
further
from
work
still
would
not
hold
true
.
there
is
no
dought
that
high
functions
self-driving
cars
would
drastically
change
our
lives
.
however
,
humans
are
creatures
of
social
nature
and
thus
instinctually
seek
out
the
companionship
and
reliability
of
other
human
beings
.
no
one
wants
to
be
far
away
from
where
they
work
,
because
the
further
one
has
to
travel
,
the
longer
they
will
have
to
wait
before
they
can
have
face-to-face
human
interaction
.
although
this
realization
of
a
new
urbanized
organization
could
come
into
light
,
the
changes
in
human
interaction
that
this
entails
would
not
come
within
the
predicted
time
range
.
people
need
time
to
adapt
to
new
technologies
,
especially
when
considering
the
social
implications
that
the
study
claims
will
happen
within
the
next
fifteen
years
.
with
the
advancements
of
ai
technologies
specific
to
transportation
,
the
changes
more
likely
be
that
of
efficiency
and
productivity
.
people
will
be
able
to
negate
the
cost
of
travels
in
their
work
and
social
lives
.
although
the
claims
made
in
this
essay
contest
the
validity
of
the
study
's
prediction
,
this
prediction
could
still
come
into
fruition
upon
later
years
.
ultimately
,
time
will
tell
what
the
final
outcome
of
the
impact
on
society
that
the
advancements
in
ai
will
have
.
