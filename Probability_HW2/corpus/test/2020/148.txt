the
article
entitled
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
presents
a
very
well-educated
guess
as
to
what
the
world
may
look
like
in
ten
years
given
the
ever-increasing
presence
of
ai
and
it
s
uses
in
society
today
.
though
the
concepts
within
seem
thoroughly
researched
,
there
are
several
statements
the
article
makes
which
i
would
like
to
challenge
the
validity
of
.
the
first
of
these
challenges
addresses
the
phrase
,
we
encourage
young
researchers
not
to
reinvent
the
wheel
,
but
rather
to
maintain
an
awareness
of
the
significant
progress
in
many
areas
of
ai
during
the
first
fifty
years
of
the
field
,
and
in
related
fields
such
as
control
theory
,
cognitive
science
,
and
psychology
.
while
i
do
think
it
important
to
not
reinvent
the
wheel
,
using
the
wheel
to
make
something
like
a
tire
,
for
instance
,
may
be
important
in
building
future
inventions
.
again
,
i
will
reference
google
to
expound
upon
my
point
.
recently
,
the
company
laid
claim
to
having
achieved
quantum
supremacy
.
a
breakthrough
such
as
this
has
the
potential
to
change
the
way
ai
is
manipulated
at
the
most
basic
computational
level
.
changing
from
bits
to
qubits
-lrb-
quantum
bits
-rrb-
calls
for
a
reimaging
of
how
ai
could
be
optimized
for
such
a
system
.
technological
breakthroughs
like
this
one
show
that
the
wheel
may
need
reinventing
at
times
.
earlier
in
the
article
,
the
writer
talks
about
rules
and
regulations
on
ai
when
he
states
,
poorly
informed
regulation
that
stifles
innovation
,
or
relocates
it
to
other
jurisdictions
,
would
be
counterproductive
.
though
i
do
agree
in
the
sense
that
ai
should
not
be
wrongfully
feared
,
i
also
believe
that
advancements
in
ai
should
be
taken
with
caution
.
in
the
spring
of
2019
,
i
sat
in
on
a
lecture
covering
ai
in
which
the
speaker
recommended
for
those
going
into
the
field
to
take
some
sort
of
philosophy
course
.
he
then
proceeded
to
explain
that
,
as
the
study
of
ai
increases
,
advanced
technology
will
most
likely
give
opportunities
for
ethical
boundaries
to
be
crossed
.
unless
these
boundaries
are
clearly
defined
before
they
are
reached
,
crossing
them
will
be
something
easily
overlooked
.
it
s
true
that
having
rules
and
regulations
may
squander
some
of
the
potential
benefits
of
ai
,
but
not
having
them
may
produce
enormous
regret
in
the
future
.
metaphorically
,
you
could
say
it
this
way
;
sometimes
building
a
fence
is
the
only
way
to
give
the
sheep
more
freedom
.
ai
is
no
exception
and
it
should
be
shepherded
well
.
another
of
the
article
s
trivial
phrases
involves
its
view
on
future
transportation
;
further
,
in
the
typical
north
american
city
in
2030
,
changes
won
t
be
limited
to
cars
and
trucks
,
but
are
likely
to
include
flying
vehicles
and
personal
robots
,
and
will
raise
social
,
ethical
and
policy
issues
.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statement
is
a
great
distance
from
reality
.
autonomous
vehicles
on
the
streets
would
be
feasible
,
but
society
is
already
slow
to
adapt
this
concept
since
it
requires
travelers
to
trust
technology
with
their
lives
.
flying
vehicles
presents
way
larger
hurdles
:
3d-space
traffic
control
,
economic
disturbance
of
road
work
job
supply
,
and
re-education
of
the
public
.
i
could
obviously
be
mistaken
,
but
the
possibility
of
flying
cars
does
not
seem
realistic
for
the
next
15
to
20
years
.
in
summary
,
my
opinions
on
ai
differ
slightly
from
those
written
in
the
article
,
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
but
the
topics
it
covers
are
quite
interesting
and
raise
some
great
points
.
no
matter
the
differences
in
opinions
,
however
,
ai
s
advancement
in
society
and
every-day
life
seems
inevitable
.
this
raises
the
need
for
careful
consideration
about
how
its
future
is
to
be
shaped
.
