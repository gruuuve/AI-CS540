ai
100
reflection
i
doubt
the
idea
that
the
well-developed
ai
prediction
tool
can
be
used
to
predict
crimes
without
human
bias
,
which
is
clamed
by
the
article
.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
,
no
matter
how
matrue
the
technique
is
believed
to
be
,
we
can
not
judge
whether
a
people
will
commit
a
crime
and
keep
an
eye
on
them
basing
on
the
result
provided
by
ai
.
firstly
,
if
a
person
is
watched
by
the
police
or
arrested
due
to
the
possibility
of
crime
that
never
happens
,
his
human
right
is
being
insulted
.
secondly
,
even
if
the
ai
crime
prediction
system
is
put
into
use
and
the
suspect
is
being
taken
action
before
the
crime
actually
happens
,
then
how
can
the
supect
being
punished
by
something
he
never
does
?
as
a
result
,
the
ai
prediction
system
will
be
full
of
contradiction
and
eventually
will
cause
chaos
to
the
legal
sysstem
.
the
article
also
points
out
that
the
ai
can
be
a
tool
for
instuctors
to
muitiply
the
size
of
their
class
by
a
few
oreders
.
though
,
it
is
true
that
by
means
of
online
studying
ai
system
,
the
size
of
class
will
not
be
restricted
by
room
capacity
or
the
time
of
of
the
instructor
,
by
no
means
should
ai
be
used
to
expand
the
classes
like
that
.
i
believe
the
interaction
between
students
and
instructor
is
much
more
important
than
the
knowledge
itself
.
in
my
opinion
,
the
most
superior
goal
of
eduaction
is
to
form
the
learning
method
in
the
students
which
is
the
unique
way
a
student
used
to
solve
a
question
and
that
unique
thinking
mode
is
developed
by
mimicing
their
instuctor
in
the
frist
place
.
it
is
the
unique
views
on
the
same
knowledge
of
different
instructors
that
create
the
diversity
of
that
filed
.
imagine
every
student
wathes
the
same
online
courses
designed
by
the
ai
all
the
time
,
no
distinct
thought
can
be
formed
and
the
diversity
of
thinking
may
disapper
which
is
really
terreble
.
what
s
more
,
i
doubt
the
idea
that
human
brain
can
be
a
choice
for
benchmarking
the
progress
of
ai
.
indeed
,
the
activities
going
on
in
a
human
brain
is
recognized
as
intellegence
,
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
model
a
algoritnm
based
on
how
brain
works
.
first
of
all
,
human
haven
t
worked
out
how
brain
actually
works
,
then
how
can
we
judeged
the
progress
of
ai
by
something
we
don
t
fully
understand
?
more
importantly
,
what
if
the
way
a
brain
works
is
not
intellgent
at
all
?
i
believe
other
more
superior
ways
to
achieve
artifital
intellegence
exist
.
last
but
not
the
least
,
the
article
put
too
much
attention
describing
how
ai
will
affect
out
lives
and
the
society
but
as
i
am
concerned
,
only
a
few
of
the
aeras
the
article
mentioned
are
mature
,
most
of
them
,
for
example
self
driving
vehicles
,
robotic
instructors
,
crime
prediction
ai
,
is
still
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
development
and
it
is
very
unlikely
will
be
put
into
application
by
2030
.
the
article
is
so
optimistic
about
the
future
of
ai
,
which
is
very
arrogant
.
for
us
who
is
studying
ai
,
we
should
put
our
main
focus
on
the
development
of
the
baisc
algorithms
and
math
principles
instead
of
putting
all
our
attetion
on
the
ethic
concerns
.
the
ai
nowaday
is
still
very
na
ve
,
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
.
