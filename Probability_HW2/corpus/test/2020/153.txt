the
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
is
an
article
written
by
the
one
hundred
year
study
of
artificial
intelligence
committee
with
the
goal
of
predicting
the
impact
and
application
of
ai
on
a
medium
sized
american
in
the
year
2030
.
predicting
the
future
is
hard
,
especially
regarding
technology
.
thomas
watson
,
chairman
of
ibm
in
1943
,
famously
said
,
``
i
think
there
is
a
world
market
for
maybe
five
computers
.
''
today
,
there
are
hundreds
of
millions
of
personal
computers
all
throughout
the
world
.
this
example
does
not
highlight
how
incorrect
watson
was
,
but
it
shows
the
difficulties
of
predicting
the
future
of
technology
,
especially
when
it
evolves
so
rapidly
.
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
makes
many
predictions
.
some
may
be
true
while
others
have
already
proven
to
be
incorrect
such
as
,
``
self-driving
cars
to
be
widely
adopted
by
2020
''
(20)
.
however
,
there
is
one
section
of
the
report
that
must
be
challenged
:
elder
care
.
the
report
suggests
that
ai
will
find
uses
in
life
quality
and
independence
,
health
and
wellness
,
and
treatments
and
devices
,
but
many
of
their
examples
either
do
not
need
ai
or
are
greatly
exaggerated
.
for
example
,
``
predictive
analytics
may
be
used
to
``
nudge
''
family
groups
toward
positive
behaviors
,
such
as
reminders
to
``
call
home
.
''''
(30)
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
predictive
analytics
are
needed
when
a
simple
weekly
reminder
can
be
used
.
another
example
is
,
``
mobile
applications
that
monitor
movement
and
activities
,
coupled
with
social
platforms
,
will
be
able
to
make
recommendations
to
maintain
mental
and
physical
health
.
''
(30)
.
today
,
many
smartwatches
do
have
these
capabilities
,
but
they
are
able
to
do
it
without
the
use
of
ai
.
the
apple
watch
only
uses
ai
to
detect
for
an
irregular
heartbeat
and
signs
of
stroke
-lrb-
two
amazing
capabilities
for
elderly
care
that
are
mostly
missed
by
the
article
-rrb-
.
these
two
examples
given
by
the
article
are
over
engineered
uses
of
ai
that
will
most
likely
not
be
used
in
2030
.
the
article
also
gives
examples
that
are
very
unlikely
to
materialize
by
the
year
2030
.
one
such
prediction
is
,
``
smart
devices
in
the
home
will
help
with
daily
living
activities
when
needed
,
such
as
cooking
''
(30)
.
cooking
a
meal
takes
a
considerable
amount
of
fine
motor
skills
such
as
mixing
,
measuring
,
cutting
,
saut√©ing
,
cleaning
,
etc.
.
it
is
very
unrealistic
to
believe
that
the
field
of
robotics
will
progress
to
that
level
by
2030
.
even
if
it
did
,
ai
would
have
to
progress
to
be
able
to
recognize
different
ingredients
,
operate
different
equipment
,
and
work
in
different
kitchen
layouts
to
have
any
market
potential
.
this
is
too
steep
of
a
challenge
to
be
predicting
for
2030
.
another
unrealistic
prediction
is
,
``
personalized
rehabilitation
and
in-home
therapy
will
reduce
the
need
for
hospital
or
care
facility
stays
''
(30)
.
health
and
medicine
are
one
of
the
most
specialized
fields
in
the
workforce
.
many
people
entering
medical
school
today
will
not
be
able
to
practice
until
the
year
2030
.
public
,
legal
,
and
medical
perceptions
will
not
have
time
to
change
in
the
next
ten
years
to
allow
ai
to
administer
unsupervised
therapy
and
recommendations
on
a
patient
.
