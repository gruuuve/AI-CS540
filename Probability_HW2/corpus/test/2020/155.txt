one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
claims
that
autonomous
transportation
will
soon
be
commonplace
and
the
public
's
perception
of
ai
will
be
strongly
influenced
.
indeed
,
today
there
are
semi-autonomous
driving
and
even
fully
autonomous
driving
cars
testing
on
the
road
.
however
,
autonomous
transportation
including
self
driving
cars
still
have
many
problems
in
terms
of
safety
of
driving
.
besides
safety
,
self
driving
cars
today
are
still
known
for
their
high
price
like
tesla
.
the
accident
of
a
tesla
model
s
in
2016
shows
the
incompleteness
of
safety
system
of
self
driving
cars
.
according
to
peter
(2019)
,
a
tesla
model
s
's
autopilot
mode
led
to
the
death
of
a
driver
by
crashing
into
an
articulated
truck
in
2016
.
the
autopilot
mode
failed
to
distinguish
a
white
truck
against
a
brightly
lit
sky
,
and
therefore
the
vehicle
did
not
apply
any
brake
at
all
.
like
this
scenario
,
there
are
many
edge
cases
like
this
accident
in
real
life
for
self
driving
cars
.
another
example
of
self
driving
cars
failing
to
drive
safely
is
the
accident
in
march
2018
.
according
to
peter
(2019)
,
uber
's
autonomous
vehicle
killed
a
woman
in
arizona
when
they
were
testing
autonomous
vehicles
.
the
accident
was
considered
the
first
autonomous
vehicle
related
pedestrian
fatality
.
after
the
accident
,
uber
technologies
stopped
autonomous
vehicle
testing
.
the
accident
mentioned
above
shows
that
self
driving
cars
are
still
far
from
accident
free
in
terms
of
protecting
both
the
driver
and
pedestrians
on
the
road
.
even
semi-autonomous
driving
systems
are
not
safe
enough
on
the
road
.
according
to
peter
(2019)
,
one
of
the
semi-autonomous
driving
systems
called
adaptive
cruise
control
is
supposed
to
accurately
lock
onto
the
car
ahead
,
matching
its
speed
.
however
,
the
system
failed
to
detect
a
vehicle
cutting
into
his
lane
with
lower
speed
.
and
there
is
another
edge
case
that
the
vehicle
applied
brakes
because
a
wrapper
covered
the
front
of
the
car
.
those
two
cases
show
that
there
are
problems
within
semi-autonomous
driving
systems
.
the
core
reason
that
it
is
more
difficult
for
self
driving
cars
to
work
than
self
driving
trains
and
planes
is
the
environment
itself
.
according
to
ben
(2019)
,
railway
systems
have
exclusive
tracks
that
limit
off
cars
,
animals
and
pedestrians
,
which
makes
railway
easier
to
make
self
driving
trains
work
.
but
in
contrast
,
roads
are
far
more
complex
and
open
,
the
self
driving
system
of
a
car
has
to
react
to
various
traffic
issues
like
different
road
signs
,
different
kinds
of
intersections
and
following
other
drivers
.
sometimes
whether
an
accident
can
be
avoided
depends
on
how
early
the
accident
is
predicted
and
how
fast
the
self
driving
system
reacting
to
the
accident
.
therefore
the
complex
system
on
the
road
push
self
driving
vehicles
to
the
limit
of
ai
and
neural
networks
.
in
conclusion
,
self
driving
cars
today
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
terms
of
safety
on
the
road
.
and
there
are
controversies
over
what
decisions
should
self
driving
vehicles
and
whose
responsibility
it
is
when
an
accident
happens
.
