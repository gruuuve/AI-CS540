artificial
intelligence
is
creating
an
intelligence
which
can
act
smarter
than
us
.
it
is
a
broad
field
that
encompasses
all
machine
behaviors
that
seem
smart
to
humans
.
traditional
ai
s
are
mostly
mathematical
algorithms
which
are
preprogrammed
by
their
creators
.
algorithms
are
proven
to
be
optimal
by
mathematicians
in
some
circumstances
to
accomplish
specific
tasks
.
ai
has
contributed
a
great
part
in
technological
advancements
which
leads
the
world
to
communicate
,
trade
and
innovate
.
world
is
full
of
data
and
feeding
this
data
to
amore
efficient
algorithm
and
train
will
give
a
predictive
model
for
weather
,
stock
market
,
disease
predictions
etc.
,
in
the
past
they
used
to
scan
brain
and
the
doctor
physically
sees
the
report
and
mentions
what
kind
of
tumor
it
is
.
.
?
.
but
now
if
we
feed
these
images
into
a
machine
which
is
trained
with
many
images
of
similar
type
will
result
what
kind
of
tumor
it
is
and
how
bad
is
it
,
will
it
effect
the
persons
health
.
etc.
.
,
some
of
the
challenging
points
as
mentioned
by
the
author
in
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
are
difficulty
of
creating
safe
and
reliable
hardware
-lrb-
transportation
and
service
robots
-rrb-
,
the
difficulty
of
smoothly
interacting
with
human
experts
-lrb-
healthcare
and
education
-rrb-
and
the
challenge
of
gaining
public
trust

i
want
to
challenge
the
healthcare
area
sector
since
i
am
pursuing
a
research
on
the
health
sector
via
ai
and
big
data
.
this
research
will
help
the
rural
doctors
of
my
country
.
since
the
rural
doctors
of
my
country
will
not
have
a
good
knowledge
about
the
health
sciences
.
i
thought
of
developing
a
model
which
takes
the
present
state
and
symptoms
of
a
person
and
predicts
the
disease
first
and
then
passing
this
into
the
disease
graph
will
obtain
cure
to
the
disease
.
first
,
this
model
will
predict
the
disease
of
the
patient
and
then
passing
on
these
inputs
to
the
disease
graph
.
we
will
create
a
disease
graph
for
each
disease
in
which
each
node
represents
the
present
symptoms
of
a
patient
and
then
the
edges
represent
the
medicines
to
attain
to
the
next
node
.
we
have
two
types
of
patients
one
is
cost
effective
and
the
other
is
time
effective
.
the
cost
effective
patients
are
type
of
patients
whose
idea
is
to
cure
the
disease
in
a
long
period
of
time
but
the
cost
must
be
minimum
as
possible
.
the
time
effective
patients
are
type
of
patients
whose
idea
is
to
cure
the
disease
in
the
minimum
time
and
they
don
t
think
about
the
cost
for
curing
the
disease
.
first
we
will
have
a
big
graph
for
each
disease
with
nodes
and
edges
.
we
will
match
the
present
node
of
the
patient
to
the
node
in
the
disease
graph
via
state
space
search
and
finding
a
shortest
route
to
the
cure
node
based
on
time
effective
or
cost
effective
.
these
nodes
are
connected
via
edges
that
is
medicines
which
helps
the
rural
doctors
by
keeping
the
present
state
of
the
patient
in
the
graph
and
attaining
the
temporary
medicines
.
so
,
in
this
way
a
rural
doctor
who
has
a
bit
knowledge
on
health
science
can
use
this
software
and
can
get
a
temporary
prescription
for
the
patient
and
also
by
training
this
model
for
a
huge
data
we
could
possibly
get
the
exact
medications
as
given
by
a
professional
doctor
.
