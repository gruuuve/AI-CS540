artificial
intelligence
in
the
next
decades
starting
from
2014
,
a
program
called
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
has
been
launched
to
inspect
ai
's
development
over
every
domain
that
human
being
relies
on
.
healthcare
and
transportation
are
the
fields
that
have
been
influenced
by
ai
whereas
they
have
the
greatest
potential
to
be
further
improved
in
the
following
10
years
.
however
,
from
the
report
of
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
,
some
concerns
are
waiting
to
be
resolved
before
ai
's
involvement
.
according
to
the
author
of
this
report
,
-lrb-
semi
-rrb-
automation
has
infiltrated
healthcare
thus
providing
more
insights
upon
developments
over
robotics
,
because
patient
care
platforms
providing
data
for
quantification
and
analysis
-lrb-
p.

-rrb-
.
this
seemingly
reasonable
idea
was
,
in
fact
,
a
self-contradictory
viewpoint
.
from
the
``
healthcare
analytics
''
section
,
the
fda
has
been
hesitated
to
encourage
the
invention
of
new
diagnostic
software
to
protect
patients
'
privacy
-lrb-
p.

-rrb-
.
these
policies
impede
information
to
be
gathered
for
patients
'
good
,
regardless
of
how
rapidly
5g
internets
are
developing
in
the
following
days
.
similarly
,
these
policies
can
hardly
release
the
ethical
pressure
over
ai
's
development
of
healthcare
in
the
next
10
years
.
moreover
,
the
entire
section
of
healthcare
-lrb-
p.25-30
-rrb-
does
not
mention
a
single
word
about
how
costly
this
database
would
be
feasible
enough
to
be
useful
.
quid
,
a
data
analysis
firm
,
reported
that
large
corporations
such
as
ibm
,
google
,
apple
,
and
microsoft
,
have
invested
up
to
$
8.5
billion
into
ai
technology
and
related
start-ups
.
this
is
a
350
%
increase
over
the
last
5
years
-lrb-
lohr
,
2016
-rrb-
.
for
example
,
a
start-up
called
livongo
raised
over
$
52.5
million
in
one
month
for
its
wireless
device
which
monitors
the
blood
glucose
of
the
diabetes
patients
-lrb-

.
this
is
only
for
the
start-up
step
,
where
companies
collect
digital
information
from
the
client
or
patients
.
the
subsequent
processes
might
require
more
money
.
these
outputs
can
be
redistributed
to
other
fields
such
as
personal
training
in
medical
schools
,
which
has
more
apparent
and
direct
support
for
healthcare
development
.
on
the
issue
about
boost
over
transportation
brought
by
artificial
intelligence
,
it
would
be
better
more
precautious
to
its
outcome
than
to
accept
it
recklessly
.
granted
,
some
parking
assisting
programs
and
tools
are
indeed
extremely
helpful
and
widely
welcomed
by
the
drivers
-lrb-
p.
19
-rrb-
,
complete
autopilots
are
still
needed
to
be
nailed
with
question
marks
as
the
accidents
are
still
appearing
frequently
.
in
december
of
2019
,
another
tesla
's
crush
,
2
deaths
found
in
the
accident
,
leads
to
the
global
attention
and
reconsideration
about
how
reliable
ai
would
be
on
roads
.
currently
,
there
is
a
blank
space
on
law
or
any
formal
regulation
around
how
responsibility
should
be
judged
when
self-driving
car
accidents
happen
:
is
this
the
driver
's
fault
or
ai
's
fault
?
when
an
emergency
happens
,
ai
can
react
more
quickly
than
people
do
,
but
they
will
also
neglect
the
aftermath
of
the
accident
.
whether
these
fundamental
concerns
would
be
treated
properly
determines
how
artificial
intelligence
grows
in
the
next
decade
.
in
conclusion
,
though
ai
benefits
spread
over
our
daily
lives
,
there
are
still
lots
of
preparation
and
regulations
to
be
focused
on
beyond
computers
and
programs
'
perfection
.
there
are
reasons
why
ai
should
not
be
adopted
in
either
healthcare
or
transportation
blindly
:
the
privacy
might
be
violated
;
the
cost
exceeds
the
budget
;
the
ethical
dilemma
is
troublesome
.
only
if
ai
companies
overcome
these
problems
,
artificial
intelligence
will
make
noticeable
progress
.
