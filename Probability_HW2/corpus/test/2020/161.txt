as
the
rapid
growth
of
artificial
intelligence
,
people
display
more
attention
to
ai
.
some
believe
that
ai
could
bring
us
a
lot
of
benefits
and
all
drawbacks
caused
by
ai
will
be
finally
removed
by
scientists
and
engineers
.
the
report
about
artificial
intelligence
from
stanford
university
clearly
demonstrates
that
ai
will
better
our
lives
.
however
,
from
some
different
perspectives
,
i
hold
suspicious
attitude
towards
some
argument
from
this
report
.
even
though
artificial
intelligence
is
now
rapidly
developing
,
many
troubles
still
await
us
.
firstly
,
the
report
says
that
ai
will
not
reduce
employment
because
it
will
create
new
jobs
and
only
reduce
tasks
rather
than
jobs
.
it
seems
like
ai
will
always
benefit
us
rather
than
somewhat
hurt
us
,
and
greatly
underestimate
the
impact
of
unemployment
caused
by
ai
.
the
job
reduced
by
ai
might
be
enormous
.
for
instance
,
there
are
almost
four
million
uber
drivers
in
the
world
.
if
autonomous
driving
is
widely
applied
,
four
million
people
will
lose
their
jobs
.
will
ai
provide
new
well-paid
jobs
for
all
these
four
million
people
?
the
answer
would
be
no.
.
jobs
provided
by
ai
now
always
need
high
education
background
and
specifically
background
of
science
and
technology
.
additionally
,
the
number
of
these
jobs
with
high
requirement
is
limited
.
it
is
hard
for
four
million
uber
drivers
to
find
these
jobs
,
which
means
they
still
do
have
jobs
.
the
article
also
believes
that
in
long
term
everyone
should
be
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
world
s
ai-produced
treasures
.
however
,
those
people
who
will
jobs
obviously
would
not
benefit
from
ai
not
to
say
share
a
portion
of
treasures
.
secondly
,
the
report
believes
that
autonomous
transportation
would
be
soon
broadly
utilized
.
people
will
trust
ai
s
reliability
and
safety
in
this
domain
.
undoubtedly
,
autonomous
transportation
has
numerous
advantages
such
as
more
comfortable
experience
and
less
cost
.
however
,
it
is
too
early
to
say
that
self-driving
cars
will
soon
be
widely
used
and
trusted
by
people
.
ai
in
self-driving
is
not
reliable
enough
now
.
it
might
cause
severe
damage
to
passengers
due
to
its
mistakes
.
for
example
,
a
tesla
car
using
autopilot
system
crashed
on
29
december
in
california
,
causing
two
persons
die
.
it
could
be
a
decent
example
to
conclude
that
ai
in
self-driving
is
far
away
from
being
trusted
.
moreover
,
privacy
concerns
still
impede
application
of
self-driving
.
now
,
companies
of
ai
are
collecting
user
s
date
.
probably
they
are
using
these
data
to
improve
their
algorithms
,
but
personal
information
actually
exists
in
their
database
.
it
is
hard
to
say
what
they
will
do
with
your
information
.
for
instance
,
facebook
collected
sensitive
personal
device
data
from
187000
users
of
its
app
.
even
though
facebook
said
they
would
not
use
data
for
terrible
purpose
,
such
behavior
still
offense
people
s
privacy
.
it
demonstrates
that
ai
could
not
be
applied
so
fast
because
we
need
more
time
to
think
about
privacy
concerns
and
governments
need
to
push
forward
laws
to
supervise
companies
using
our
valuable
personal
information
.
in
conclusion
,
applying
ai
in
everyone
s
daily
lives
still
face
some
challenging
such
as
unemployment
and
privacy
leak
.
it
is
too
early
to
say
all
challenges
caused
by
artificial
intelligence
can
be
solved
soon
and
ai
will
change
our
lives
in
near
future
.
of
course
,
the
report
states
some
unsupported
arguments
