artificial
intelligence
may
be
one
of
the
most
promising
tech
fields
for
the
future
of
our
society
.
its
applications
are
seemingly
endless
and
all
of
them
have
the
potential
to
radically
change
our
daily
life
.
this
portion
of
the
report
i
am
in
full
agreement
with
but
there
are
a
few
things
i
believe
will
hinder
the
progression
of
ai
in
our
society
that
this
report
either
leaves
out
or
disagrees
with
.
the
two
things
i
will
contest
in
this
essay
are
the
future
ai
has
with
our
data
and
the
adoption
of
ai
to
increase
freedom
for
certain
groups
.
in
the
report
,
they
claim
that
self-driving
cars
have
the
potential
to
create
more
freedom
for
specific
groups
such
as
the
elderly
,
disabled
,
and
children
.
while
i
do
n't
entirely
disagree
,
i
feel
some
of
these
groups
may
have
trouble
adopting
this
new
technology
.
in
the
case
of
the
elderly
many
of
them
may
not
be
able
to
make
full
use
of
this
technology
or
understand
it
.
the
report
does
bring
this
up
stating
that
the
elderly
are
becoming
more
technologically
advanced
but
i
would
still
argue
this
is
not
enough
.
ai
is
still
cutting-edge
technology
and
most
of
the
elderly
people
i
know
still
have
trouble
using
a
computer
.
this
combined
with
general
stubbornness
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
believe
this
will
be
and
easily
adopted
technology
in
the
elderly
population
.
as
for
children
,
i
believe
legislation
on
motor
vehicle
operation
will
be
a
hindrance
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
how
these
laws
will
be
modified
to
include
self-driving
cars
is
yet
to
be
seen
but
i
believe
once
they
are
changed
,
they
will
likely
still
prevent
children
and
those
without
a
license
from
driving
.
this
means
there
will
be
little
impact
on
the
freedom
of
children
or
the
elderly
who
do
n't
have
licenses
.
all
this
being
said
,
i
do
believe
this
technology
has
the
ability
to
make
driving
much
safer
for
the
children
and
elderly
who
are
able
to
utilize
it
.
the
second
issue
i
have
with
the
report
is
the
lack
of
concern
with
privacy
and
data
usage
.
it
is
brought
up
in
multiple
places
,
but
the
main
concern
used
was
public
opinion
rather
than
privacy
.
i
have
many
issues
with
the
methods
of
data
collection
used
today
even
with
its
usage
in
advancing
technology
.
however
,
i
'm
going
to
focus
on
some
of
the
issues
that
could
be
presented
with
future
policies
as
opposed
to
my
opinions
.
given
the
trends
we
have
had
with
data
collection
and
privacy
on
the
internet
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
we
see
a
significant
increase
in
legislation
protecting
user
data
in
the
future
.
while
this
is
arguably
beneficial
for
the
general
population
this
would
likely
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
advancement
of
ai
.
given
ai
's
reliance
on
large
quantities
of
data
to
become
useful
future
legislation
could
create
some
issues
in
the
advancement
and
implementation
of
ai
.
with
less
data
to
work
with
researchers
would
have
to
find
alternate
ways
of
training
their
ai
's
and
different
methods
for
deploying
them
to
the
general
public
.
overall
,
i
agree
with
a
lot
of
the
things
this
report
explored
and
only
had
some
issues
with
a
few
smaller
points
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
.
while
privacy
and
public
adoption
of
these
new
technologies
could
pose
some
problems
,
in
the
end
,
i
believe
ai
has
a
great
future
ahead
of
it
.
with
its
numerous
applications
and
significant
impact
on
existing
systems
ai
has
the
chance
to
truly
change
the
world
as
we
know
it
.
