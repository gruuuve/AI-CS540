today
,
artificial
intelligence
seems
to
still
be
in
the
infant
stage
of
its
possibilities
.
artificial
intelligence
has
started
to
make
its
mark
in
the
world
but
in
its
current
state
,
ai
applications
are
mostly
tailored
to
do
just
one
type
of
task
.
thankfully
,
this
means
the
likelihood
of
an
artificial
super
intelligence
coming
to
enslave
us
all
is
still
a
ways
away
from
reality
.
however
,
even
the
ai
emerging
today
could
pose
a
threat
to
society
if
proper
policies
are
not
put
into
place
to
mitigate
damages
from
resulting
unemployment
and
patch
ai
's
potential
to
be
abused
.
throughout
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
,
the
standing
committee
states
that
artificial
intelligence
should
be
a
benefit
to
everyone
in
society
.
however
,
their
recommendations
for
policy
are
based
on
an
overly
optimistic
outlook
for
the
future
of
ai
.
one
application
of
ai
receiving
a
lot
of
attention
today
is
self-driving
vehicles
.
self-driving
vehicles
are
real
and
right
around
the
corner
from
dominating
the
streets
.
as
a
result
,
this
has
sparked
the
need
for
discourse
concerning
what
will
happen
when
ai
takes
over
jobs
like
truck
driving
,
displacing
millions
of
americans
of
their
jobs
.
the
report
mentions
that
policies
must
``
foster
democratic
values
and
equitable
sharing
of
ai
's
benefits
''
rather
than
``
concentrate
power
and
benefits
in
the
hands
of
a
fortunate
few
''
(11)
.
while
this
sounds
great
on
paper
,
it
just
does
n't
seem
possible
.
in
what
world
will
the
tech
giants
of
the
world
share
the
benefits
of
their
ai
for
free
after
spending
millions
on
research
and
design
.
it
seems
much
more
likely
that
the
companies
making
self-driving
vehicles
will
make
a
lot
more
money
and
the
former
truck
drivers
of
the
world
,
will
simply
be
left
out
.
to
protect
ourselves
against
this
the
report
says
we
need
to
``
define
a
path
toward
accruing
technical
expertise
in
ai
at
all
levels
of
the
government
''
or
else
``
officials
will
be
poorly
positioned
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
ai
on
programmatic
objectives
''
(43)
.
while
it
is
true
we
need
this
,
the
report
also
admits
a
sufficient
path
is
currently
absent
.
given
our
current
government
,
relying
on
officials
being
properly
educated
on
the
topics
of
ai
and
standing
up
to
lobbying
of
big
tech
giants
is
simply
too
optimistic
.
another
potentially
problematic
use
of
ai
,
right
around
the
corner
,
is
the
use
of
ai
in
surveillance
.
with
major
us
cities
having
millions
of
citizens
,
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
have
humans
oversee
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cameras
.
this
is
where
ai
comes
in
,
to
automate
this
oversight
.
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
chose
to
focus
only
on
north
american
cities
,
as
a
result
,
mass
surveillance
in
china
was
not
discussed
and
not
related
to
the
potential
privacy
concerns
as
the
pertains
to
north
american
cities
.
like
humans
,
ai-based
surveillance
has
the
potential
for
bias
to
appear
,
especially
since
ai
is
created
by
humans
.
the
report
does
mention
that
with
proper
attention
to
detail
and
proper
oversight
,
ai
has
the
potential
to
``
make
less
bias
decisions
than
a
typical
person
''
(46)
.
however
,
all
this
lies
heavily
of
the
government
to
implement
the
proper
oversight
and
regulations
to
ensure
privacy
and
the
proper
legal
considerations
are
taken
care
of
.
