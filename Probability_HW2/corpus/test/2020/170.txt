in
recent
years
,
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
has
been
used
in
more
and
more
fields
in
people
's
daily
lives
.
from
natural
language
process
,
which
people
are
more
familiar
with
,
to
potential
auto-drive
cars
,
ai
has
become
a
heated
field
of
study
.
in
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
,
the
author
talks
about
the
current
development
of
ai
,
domains
of
ai
,
as
well
as
potential
policies
that
can
be
made
concerning
problems
that
may
arise
as
ai
continues
to
prevail
.
the
author
holds
the
opinion
that
ai
,
if
used
appropriately
and
wisely
,
is
of
benefit
to
human
society
in
multiple
fields
,
although
ai
may
also
give
rise
to
some
problems
.
while
discussing
the
domains
of
ai
,
he
goes
into
details
of
the
current
situation
and
development
,
future
trends
and
challenges
of
each
filed
in
a
scientific
way
.
however
,
there
are
some
minor
points
that
i
would
like
to
challenge
.
the
author
generally
holds
an
optimistic
view
towards
different
applications
of
ai
,
meanwhile
pointing
out
potential
problems
.
however
,
some
problems
of
ai
are
still
ignored
.
the
author
states
that
self-driving
car
is
expected
to
cause
decrease
in
number
of
private
cars
people
owned
,
further
enabling
people
to
spend
time
that
used
to
be
used
for
driving
to
work
or
entertain
-lrb-
p.

.
nevertheless
,
i
believe
that
even
people
free
themselves
from
driving
,
the
time
can
hardly
be
spent
efficiently
and
meaningfully
,
nor
will
the
number
of
cars
owned
by
people
decrease
much
.
now
,
there
are
already
public
transportations
and
uber
by
which
people
is
able
to
not
drive
by
themselves
.
yet
,
people
can
hardly
do
their
work
or
entertainment
during
the
transportation
time
due
to
disturbance
of
other
people
,
uncomfortable
environment
-lrb-
public
transportations
-rrb-
and
motion
sickness
that
may
be
caused
-lrb-
uber
-rrb-
.
also
,
even
with
the
existence
of
public
transportation
and
uber
,
number
of
cars
people
own
is
still
high
.
self-driving
car
,
whose
aim
includes
free
people
from
driving
,
which
is
similar
to
that
of
public
transportation
and
uber
,
is
unlikely
to
decrease
number
of
cars
much
.
besides
,
driving
by
oneself
is
not
only
more
convenient
,
but
more
economic
.
the
time
waiting
for
public
transportation
,
stop
that
take
place
will
both
waste
people
time
.
also
,
uber
is
much
expensive
than
driving
on
one
's
own
,
which
is
likely
the
case
of
self-driving
car
as
the
cost
of
ai
may
be
high
resulting
from
difficulty
and
high
cost
of
inventing
,
researching
and
maintaining
.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
talk
about
is
the
author
's
statement
that
ai
can
lower
cost
of
goods
and
services
by
replacing
human
labor
who
need
wages
.
however
,
while
ai
system
can
lead
to
decrease
in
price
of
good
,
it
also
can
predict
affordability
of
different
groups
and
then
sell
the
same
product
at
different
prices
to
different
buyers
,
in
order
to
maximize
sales
and
profits
.
such
phenomenon
has
already
been
reported
on
news
and
does
not
help
lowering
price
at
all
.
moreover
,
this
may
cause
the
money
and
social
resource
be
more
and
more
gained
by
the
sellers
and
capital
,
lead
to
certain
degree
of
inequality
.
as
a
result
,
i
believe
government
should
issue
accordingly
law
to
deal
with
the
problem
and
control
and
interfere
the
market
when
necessary
.
