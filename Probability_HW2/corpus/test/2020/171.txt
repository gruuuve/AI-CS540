in
the
classic
portrayal
of
artificial
intelligence
,
it
is
viewed
by
society
as
something
that
will
eventually
take
over
the
human
race
.
but
as
seen
in
the
article
,
the
more
accurate
portrayal
of
artificial
intelligence
is
something
that
will
only
lend
itself
to
enhance
the
human
race
in
daily
activities
.
for
the
most
part
,
i
agree
with
stanford
university
article
.
however
,
there
are
a
few
areas
in
which
i
disagree
.
the
main
area
which
i
find
the
most
problems
with
is
the
entertainment
topic
.
in
the
article
,
there
are
several
ways
in
which
ai
is
shows
to
enhance
entertainment
.
in
this
essay
i
am
going
to
explain
my
opinion
on
why
the
entertainment
industry
will
be
one
of
the
things
that
is
least
influenced
by
ai
.
first
,
i
am
going
to
grant
the
author
of
the
article
some
of
the
points
that
were
made
.
i
sunderstand
how
ai
is
being
used
in
the
social
media
space
in
catering
different
content
depending
on
the
user
.
however
,
there
are
certain
things
in
which
i
believe
the
extent
of
ai
can
not
be
fully
utilized
in
-lrb-
at
least
before
2030
-rrb-
.
the
first
topic
that
came
to
mind
is
art
.
in
my
opinion
,
artificial
intelligence
will
never
be
able
to
fully
take
over
the
art
industry
or
even
come
to
the
point
where
it
can
remove
the
creative
process
for
artists
.
at
a
point
,
i
feel
like
there
will
be
a
resurgence
of
people
who
begin
to
use
more
natural
ways
of
thinking
of
art
and
creating
art
because
it
adds
to
the
appearance
and
essence
of
the
work
of
art
.
ai
will
never
be
able
to
reach
the
level
of
creativity
that
a
human
brain
can
and
for
that
reason
i
believe
that
there
will
not
be
able
to
be
much
more
progress
in
terms
of
what
ai
can
do
for
people
in
the
art
industry
.
another
reason
i
believe
ai
will
not
be
able
to
take
over
the
art
industry
is
because
of
the
way
that
society
views
technology
.
it
seems
that
although
technology
is
there
to
make
life
more
convenient
,
in
the
entertainment
industry
people
would
end
up
finding
more
value
in
products
that
are
more
natural
and
hand-made
.
the
second
part
of
the
entertainment
industry
that
i
believe
wo
n't
be
able
to
be
dominated
by
artificial
intelligence
is
the
sports
industry
.
once
again
,
i
believe
that
the
involvement
of
ai
that
is
present
now
will
not
be
surpassed
by
a
great
amount
.
in
terms
of
analyzing
game
situations
,
ai
will
only
be
able
to
be
further
developed
by
adding
more
game
data
to
create
better
models
for
prediction
.
however
,
there
are
a
few
things
that
ai
will
not
be
able
to
get
fully
involved
in
.
first
,
it
will
never
be
able
to
take
over
the
attraction
of
human
players
in
the
sport
-lrb-
again
at
least
not
in
the
next
10
years
-rrb-
.
second
,
it
will
not
be
able
to
take
away
from
the
trust
aspect
that
coaches
and
managers
have
for
certain
players
.
data
and
ai
can
only
predict
so
much
.
human
interaction
is
the
only
thing
that
will
be
able
to
fully
analyze
players
and
situations
based
on
how
players
feel
in
certain
situations
.
ai
would
need
to
analyze
millions
of
games
to
even
get
close
to
the
interaction
that
humans
have
and
in
my
opinion
that
will
not
be
achieved
by
2030
.
for
these
reasons
i
believe
that
ai
will
not
be
able
to
enter
the
entertainment
space
to
the
extent
that
it
can
in
the
other
industries
.
