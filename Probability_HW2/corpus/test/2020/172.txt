the
author
claims
that
certain
types
of
regulation
may
be
counterproductive
but
it
is
reasonable
for
some
regulation
to
be
implemented
.
increased
regulation
may
be
necessary
to
reduce
the
potentially
catastrophic
impacts
that
artificial
intelligence
could
have
on
specific
sectors
of
the
economy
.
for
example
,
the
average
trucker
is
a
55-year-old
male
with
a
high-school
or
limited
college
education
who
would
most
likely
face
many
challenges
in
repurposing
themselves
.
implementing
self-driving
trucks
with
little
regulation
would
most
likely
disrupt
the
trucking
ecosystem
and
leave
hundreds
of
thousands
,
even
millions
,
of
people
with
little
alternative
for
income
.
it
would
be
quite
difficult
for
independent
truckers
and
firms
to
compete
with
self-driving
trucks
as
these
trucks
could
quite
literally
drive
for
24
hours
straight
,
while
humans
are
capped
by
a
maximum
daily
driving
limit
.
long
term
regulation
would
stifle
innovation
;
however
,
short
term
regulation
to
balance
the
impact
on
communities
with
little
workforce
alternatives
could
mitigate
the
massive
existential
threat
to
these
workers
.
by
forcing
corporations
that
use
artificial
intelligence
at
the
expense
of
its
laborers
to
slowly
integrate
artificial
intelligence
,
it
may
cause
short
term
slowing
of
economic
growth
but
enable
its
workers
to
have
an
advantage
in
repurposing
themselves
once
they
are
released
.
therefore
i
would
endorse
regulation
on
the
implementation
of
ai
into
the
economy
,
but
not
on
the
actual
creation
of
artificial
intelligence
itself
as
ai
can
reduce
the
required
hard
labor
usually
done
by
people
.
this
is
a
key
difference
as
the
regulation
would
not
directly
inhibit
ai
innovation
itself
.
however
,
one
could
argue
that
by
slowing
its
integration
,
profit
and
success
of
artificial
intelligence
would
also
be
slowed
,
and
some
may
see
it
as
less
effective
and
devote
fewer
resources
to
its
development
overall
.
in
the
second
reference
,
the
author
implies
that
ai
ca
n't
completely
breach
all
jobs
and
this
is
certainly
true
in
the
short
term
.
the
report
states
that
``
ai
is
poised
to
replace
people
in
certain
kinds
of
jobs
,
such
as
in
the
driving
of
taxis
and
trucks
.
''
autonomous
driving
will
disrupt
these
driving
industries
greatly
but
even
occupations
with
higher
cognitive
and
physical
demands
will
also
be
affected
.
most
would
think
that
fields
like
legal
work
and
dentistry
would
be
safe
havens
from
artificial
intelligence
but
there
are
certain
aspects
in
these
jobs
which
are
already
in
the
process
of
being
automated
.
it
is
true
that
``
certain
tasks
''
will
be
replaced
in
the
near
term
,
but
the
scope
of
jobs
affected
is
much
bigger
.
in
china
,
the
first
successful
dental
implant
by
automation
was
conducted
with
great
results
which
reveals
how
``
more
valued
''
jobs
in
society
are
n't
even
as
safe
.
some
estimates
even
predict
that
authoring
and
many
types
of
surgeons
could
be
fully
automated
with
artificial
intelligence
by
2049
and
2053
respectively
.
evidence
of
this
is
apparent
as
many
types
of
journalists
in
topics
like
fantasy
football
have
been
totally
automated
as
weekly
player
reviews
can
be
generated
by
ibm
's
watson
.
these
player
reviews
usually
took
days
to
come
out
with
as
there
are
hundreds
of
players
to
cover
in
the
industry
,
but
artificial
intelligence
was
capable
of
writing
all
the
player
summaries
instantly
.
more
impressive
was
the
degree
of
accuracy
in
projecting
points
and
player
outcomes
.
therefore
,
artificial
intelligence
extends
its
grip
to
nearly
every
occupation
and
job
security
is
threatened
in
many
fields
,
in
the
long
term
.
