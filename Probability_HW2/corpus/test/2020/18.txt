in
the
summer
of
2018
,
my
family
and
i
were
traveling
between
destinations
in
banff
national
park
of
canada
.
i
clearly
remember
driving
up
a
long
winding
road
that
encircled
a
mountain
when
the
google
maps
machine
learning
algorithm
instructed
us
to
turn
left
.
unfortunately
,
making
a
left
turn
would
have
resulted
in
us
driving
off
a
massive
cliff
and
plummeting
to
our
absolutely
certain
deaths
.
we
laughed
at
google
maps
at
the
time
.
little
did
i
know
that
similar
technology
would
be
used
to
govern
self-driving
cars
in
the
near
future
.
according
to
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
self
driving
cars
are
expected
to
be
widely
adopted
by
2020
.
there
is
no
doubt
that
reliable
self-driving
cars
will
improve
life
expectancy
and
the
overall
quality
of
life
for
people
globally
.
however
,
the
integration
of
driverless
cars
into
modern
society
will
be
a
difficult
process
and
raises
questions
on
if
the
general
public
is
ready
to
utilize
self-driving
cars
.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
i
am
not
criticizing
the
current
state
of
artificial
intelligence
car
technology
.
in
fact
,
google
has
already
developed
a
completely
autonomous
car
that
has
logged
300,000
miles
without
an
accident
.
however
,
i
challenge
the
article
's
claim
that
once
driverless
technology
is
made
safe
its
introduction
into
daily
life
will
be
immediate
.
i
feel
that
it
will
take
some
time
after
the
technology
is
fully
developed
for
legal
systems
to
be
established
and
for
the
public
to
gain
trust
in
driverless
cars
.
many
people
might
still
prefer
to
drive
because
they
trust
themselves
more
than
they
trust
artificial
intelligence
.
semi-autonomous
vehicles
have
already
been
made
available
to
the
public
but
have
actually
hurt
the
public
's
trust
in
driverless
artificial
intelligence
technology
.
in
june
2016
,
a
tesla
model
s
owner
tragically
passed
away
after
putting
his
semi-autonomous
car
on
autopilot
mode
.
the
model
s
sensors
failed
to
detect
a
large
white
truck
and
attempted
to
drive
full
speed
underneath
the
truck
's
trailer
.
since
this
incident
,
semi-autonomous
cars
have
been
under
criticism
because
as
drivers
gain
confidence
in
their
car
's
capabilities
,
they
are
unlikely
to
pay
attention
to
the
road
when
their
help
is
needed
most
.
this
incident
also
caused
many
people
to
become
skeptical
of
completely
autonomous
vehicles
.
it
is
also
important
to
acknowledge
the
large-scale
consumption
of
artificial
intelligence
cars
also
raises
issues
in
ethics
and
justice
.
when
a
driverless
car
is
put
in
a
situation
when
human
injuries
are
inevitable
,
the
car
needs
to
be
programmed
to
make
the
most
ethical
decision
in
a
split
second
.
most
states
in
the
us
and
other
countries
of
the
world
do
not
yet
have
laws
covering
the
ethics
of
self-driving
cars
.
furthermore
,
the
laws
that
have
already
been
passed
do
not
address
whom
is
it
at
fault
for
an
accident
involving
a
driverless
car
.
for
driverless
cars
to
become
widely
adopted
by
the
general
public
these
legal
systems
need
to
be
established
first
.
