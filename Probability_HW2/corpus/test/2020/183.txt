public

while
this
is
certainly
a
possibility
,
it
does
not
seem
likely
given
our
current
familiarity
with
and
dependency
on
public
transportation
systems
.
in
cities
across
the
world
,
public
transportation
systems
are
evolving
to
come
more
efficient
and
user-friendly
.
as
artificial
intelligence
progresses
,
self-driving
cars
and
shared
transportation
will
come
more
accessible
to
the
public
.
however
,
public
transportation
will
progress
concurrently
and
maintain
its
relevance
in
society
.
across
the
globe
and
specifically
in
china
,
public
transportation
systems
are
adopting
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
to
make
the
process
more
streamlined
,
safer
,
and
faster
.
there
are
already
many
prototypes
for
driverless
trains
,
and
engineers
in
london
recently
put
one
to
the
test
.
once
this
idea
is
fully
polished
and
ready
for
public
use
,
public
transportation
systems
will
be
able
to
support
a
larger
number
of
passengers
,
as
driverless
trains
do
n't
require
cabs
for
drivers
.
this
advancement
will
make
public
transportation
a
better
option
for
users
,
as
they
likely
will
not
have
to
wait
as
long
to
catch
a
ride
.
in
china
,
engineers
are
testing
a
rail
system
that
would
not
require
tracks
,
but
instead
would
use
painted
lines
for
the
train
to
follow
.
these
are
known
as
``
virtual
tracks
''
.
with
this
up
and
coming
technology
,
rail
systems
can
be
built
at
a
much
lower
price
and
faster
than
ever
without
requiring
the
labor
of
building
train
tracks
.
when
this
technology
is
perfected
,
in
synthesis
with
driverless
trains
,
public
transportation
will
become
an
even
more
attractive
mode
of
transportation
.
not
only
will
the
physical
vehicles
progress
,
but
also
peripheral
technology
such
as
applications
and
websites
used
for
public
transportation
.
every
day
,
new
apps
are
created
to
connect
users
with
whatever
their
public
transportation
needs
may
be
:
scheduling
bus
rides
,
buying
train
tickets
,
etc.
.
many
of
these
apps
offer
real-time
updates
on
which
seats
are
available
,
when
a
vehicle
will
be
arriving
,
etc.
.
one
example
is
the
trainline
app
,
which
uses
bots
to
ask
train
riders
how
busy
their
car
is
,
and
reports
this
data
back
to
its
users
.
these
apps
will
continue
to
progress
and
become
more
and
more
accurate
and
reliable
in
their
understanding
of
the
transportation
systems
.
around
the
world
,
commuters
are
testing
out
microchip
implants
which
work
as
tickets
for
certain
buses
and
trains
.
while
this
does
not
directly
relate
to
artificial
intelligence
,
this
advancement
shows
how
deeply
rooted
public
transportation
in
our
society
.
people
rely
on
public
transportation
so
much
that
they
will
literally
have
something
surgically
implanted
in
their
bodies
.
despite
the
significant
advances
being
made
in
the
world
of
personal
transportation
,
such
as
driverless
cars
and
small
capacity
on-demand
transport
,
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
public
transportation
will
be
wiped
out
.
with
the
advancements
being
made
in
public
transportation
,
it
seems
as
though
it
will
actually
rise
in
popularity
.
