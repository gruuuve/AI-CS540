the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
covers
a
number
of
different
potential
issues
regarding
the
continued
development
of
ai
over
the
next
fifteen
years
.
one
issue
covered
in
the
report
is
politics
,
namely
how
political
actors
can
and
have
used
ai
technology
to
manipulate
the
democratic
process
.
specifically
,
the
report
mentions
the
usage
of
gerrymandering
,
``
robocalls
,
''
and
social
media
``
bots
.
''
while
these
uses
of
ai
threaten
the
fairness
of
american
democracy
,
it
is
a
strategy
that
can
be
abused
by
politicians
in
both
political
parties
,
which
would
keep
them
relatively
in
check
.
the
more
concerning
use
of
ai
in
the
realm
of
politics
could
come
in
the
form
of
suppression
of
free
speech
.
the
united
states
government
could
deploy
ai
technology
to
suppress
messages
critical
of
the
government
and
government
officials
.
this
suppression
would
n't
necessarily
take
the
form
of
an
outright
prohibition
of
anti-government
messages
,
but
rather
a
more
subtle
stalling
of
outreach
.
for
example
,
a
tweet
critical
of
government
action
could
get
detected
by
an
ai
algorithm
,
leading
to
that
specific
tweet
not
showing
up
in
other
users
'
news
feeds
.
while
the
author
of
the
message
would
see
it
being
sent
out
,
other
twitter
users
would
n't
be
able
to
see
the
tweet
,
practically
deleting
unbeknownst
to
the
author
.
this
is
only
one
example
of
the
ways
the
government
could
use
ai
to
monitor
and
manipulate
the
american
people
.
while
the
report
focuses
on
issues
that
can
be
caused
by
ai
,
it
primarily
recommends
solutions
grounded
in
government
regulations
,
ignoring
cases
in
which
government
actors
are
,
themselves
,
the
perpetrators
and
abusers
of
new
ai
technology
.
