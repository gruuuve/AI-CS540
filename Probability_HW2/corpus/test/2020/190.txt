intelligence

report

''
the
author
claims
that
``
though
quality
education
will
always
require
active
engagement
by
human
teachers
,
ai
promises
to
enhance
education
at
all
levels
,
especially
by
providing
personalization
at

what
the
author
suggests
is
that
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
will
improve
the
overall
quality
of
education
by
focusing
on
simulating
human
interaction
.
however
,
i
would
not
agree
with
this
point
because
of
some
practical
problems
that
ai
brings
to
education
.
admittedly
,
educational
technology
that
has
already
implemented
like
online
tutoring
contributes
to
the
improvement
of
education
.
due
to
the
appearance
of
such
technology
,
students
could
have
much
easier
access
to
the
assistance
they
need
.
nonetheless
,
those
artificial
intelligent
tutors
can
not
improve
themselves
like
human
beings
by
repetitions
.
for
most
of
us
,
when
we
are
doing
some
specific
jobs
,
we
could
notice
that
it
is
always
getting
better
during
repetitions
of
work
.
this
is
mostly
because
people
are
experientially
learning
.
kolb
(1984)
states
that
people
can
grasp
and
transforming
experience
into
knowledge
.
the
knowledge
that
people
gain
from
their
experiences
could
then
help
people
to
succeed
in
their
jobs
.
instructors
would
also
learn
when
they
repeatedly
teach
.
year
by
year
,
they
would
be
able
to
get
better
at
their
jobs
.
instead
,
artificial
intelligent
tutors
,
following
the
instruction
of
algorithms
,
could
not
obtain
such
ability
.
when
those
artificial
intelligent
tutors
fail
to
improve
themselves
,
they
would
not
be
able
to
offer
high-quality
education
to
students
as
expected
.
additionally
,
even
though
ai
could
help
to
improve
quality
education
,
ai
in
education
with
a
much
higher
cost
than
traditional
education
can
greatly
restrict
families
with
low
income
to
enjoy
education
at
the
same
level
.
to
get
access
to
ai
education
,
parents
have
to
spend
more
budget
for
their
kids
since
education
with
advanced
technology
is
usually
an
expensive
option
.
such
high
expense
could
greatly
increase
the
burden
for
families
with
low
income
.
this
burden
might
lead
kids
to
drop
out
of
school
to
save
the
budget
for
their
family
.
losing
the
chance
to
receive
a
high-quality
education
,
those
kids
will
be
less
competitive
when
they
grow
up
,
and
the
gap
between
rich
and
poor
will
greatly
widen
because
of
that
.
the
consequence
could
be
devastating
to
many
kids
and
even
to
the
whole
society
.
thus
,
ai
indeed
can
not
bring
improvement
but
inverse
effects
.
in
another
paragraph
of
the
article
,
the
author
states
that
``
ai
will
likely
replace
tasks
rather
than
jobs
in
the
near
term
,
and
will
also
create
new
kinds
of
jobs
.
''
the
author
means
to
show
that
while
ai
takes
over
some
jobs
from
workers
,
the
other
jobs
that
were
created
accordingly
will
compensate
for
the
loss
.
it
is
also
indicated
that
such
replacement
will
be
gradual
and
would
not
transit
sharply
.
however
,
it
would
still
potentially
elevate
the
unemployment
rate
greatly
due
to
disproportion
of
job
opportunities
.
for
those
low-skilled
jobs
that
will
be
replaced
by
ai
,
the
quantity
could
be
huge
since
low-skilled
workers
take
a
great
proportion
in
the
market
.
the
jobs
that
ai
would
create
,
instead
,
are
highly
advanced
and
low
in
quantity
.
the
disproportion
would
lead
to
a
sharp
increase
in
the
unemployment
rate
even
though
at
a
gradual
pace
.
