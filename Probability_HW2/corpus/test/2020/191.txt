the
article
has
an
overly
optimistic
outlook
on
the
impact
of
introducing
ai
into
the
workplace
.
until
the
issues
of
gender
and
socioeconomic
equality
are
effectively
addressed
and
tackled
in
a
sustainable
way
,
introducing
ai
into
the
workforce
has
the
potential
to
inflict
lasting
damage
on
gender
parity
and
socioeconomic
inequality
.
the
article
claims
,
``
because
ai
systems
perform
work
that
previously
required
human
labor
,
they
have
the
effect
of
lowering
the
cost
of
many
goods
and
services
,
effectively
making
everyone
richer
.
''
saying
that
everyone
will
be
richer
is
a
bold
statement
,
considering
that
most
jobs
ai
will
replace
will
be
jobs
held
by
populations
that
would
be
hard-pressed
to
access
jobs
created
by
ai
.
in
a
study
conducted
by
mckinsey
global
institute
,
between
40-160
million
women
worldwide
are
in
danger
of
being
displaced
by
ai
technologies
,
in
the
wake
of
automating
secretarial
and
bookkeeping
jobs
.
thus
,
introducing
ai
into
the
workforce
could
widen
gender
pay
gap
as
women
are
driven
out
of
the
workforce
by
jobs
they
have
traditionally
held
.
while
gender
parity
has
been
improving
worldwide
in
the
recent
decades
,
it
has
improved
slower
than
the
pace
at
which
technology
has
advanced
.
according
to
the
un
,
of
186
countries
in
the
world
,
104
still
have
laws
restricting
women
from
working
in
certain
jobs
,
59
countries
have
no
laws
against
sexual
harassment
in
the
workplace
,
and
in
18
countries
,
husbands
can
prevent
their
wives
from
working
.
the
introduction
of
ai
to
the
workplace
would
only
further
restrict
female
access
to
jobs
,
and
the
high-skilled
jobs
ai
would
create
in
male-dominated
sectors
would
remain
inaccessible
.
traditionally
under
resourced
are
especially
at
risk
of
negative
impact
from
introducing
ai
into
the
workforce
.
a
2019
report
by
the
brookings
institute
reveals
the
most
affected
ethnic
groups
are
hispanics
,
american
indians
and
african
americans
,
who
represent
only
15
%
of
the
workforce
yet
make
up
a
third
of
the
workforce
in
extraction
and
construction
industries
.
they
also
disproportionately
represent
much
of
the
workforce
in
food
preparation
and
serving
related
industries
,
listed
as
the
most
susceptible
to
automation
.
furthermore
,
hispanics
and
blacks
make
up
less
than
10
%
of
education
or
managerial
jobs
,
which
are
among
the
least
susceptible
to
automation
.
the
article
appears
optimistic
about
ai
as
an
impetus
for
disseminating
public
services
,
but
in
countries
such
as
the
united
states
,
government
social
services
are
less
effectively
implemented
than
in
countries
cited
in
the
article
,
switzerland
and
finland
,
both
small
and
relatively
homogeneous
countries
.
social
mobility
in
the
united
states
is
much
more
restricted
than
in
nordic
countries
;
according
to
a
study
by
swedish
economist
markus
jantti
,
42
%
of
males
raised
in
the
bottom
fifth
of
incomes
stay
there
as
adults
,
compared
to
28
%
in
finland
.
according
to
a
study
by
the
pew
research
institute
,
62
%
of
the
top
fifth
of
incomes
stay
in
the
top
two-fifths
.
the
lack
of
upward
mobility
,
and
potential
to
access
jobs
either
created
by
ai
or
less
susceptible
to
ai
,
is
a
result
of
centuries
of
thin
safety
nets
,
high
incarceration
rates
,
and
institutionalized
racism
beyond
the
control
of
ai
.
in
conclusion
,
the
authors
'
claims
of
potential
socioeconomic
gains
from
introducing
ai
into
the
workforce
need
more
evidence
,
as
the
introduction
of
ai
could
potential
lower
gender
parity
and
widen
the
socioeconomic
wealth
gap
.
