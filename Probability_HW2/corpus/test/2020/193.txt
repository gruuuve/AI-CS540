the
predictions
made
in
the
hundred-year
ai
study
for
ai
's
future
in
education
seem
too
optimistic
,
and
omit
some
side-effects
-lrb-
that
i
predict
-rrb-
of
ai
becoming
more
prominent
in
k-12
and
higher
education
.
they
do
admit
that
no
matter
what
,
ai
ca
n't
entirely
replace
human
teachers
,
but
i
think
they
overestimate
how
much
teaching
ai
can
do
.
ai
likely
will
become
much
more
proficient
in
speech\/text
recognition
and
analysis
,
but
the
paper
suggests
that
moocs
will
be
able
to
analyze
and
grade
students
'
short
answers
and
essays
,
and
i
struggle
to
see
this
working
as
well
as
a
human
grader
.
there
are
two
main
omissions
from
an
ai
grading
someone
's
written
answer
or
essay
;
style
and
topic\/connections
.
an
ai
grader
lacks
subjectivity
and
taste
,
and
while
it
would
likely
be
able
to
consistently
recognize
what
it
has
defined
`
good
writing
,
'
i
struggle
to
see
it
understanding
appropriate
vs
inappropriate
use
of
idioms
,
slang
,
and
unorthodox
-lrb-
but
well
executed
-rrb-
writing
styles
.
maybe
i
'm
underestimating
the
power
of
deep
learning
and
ai
will
end
up
having
more
taste
and
reading
comprehension
than
the
best
of
us
,
but
to
me
it
seems
more
likely
that
ai
graders
being
common
would
lead
to
students
standardizing
their
unique
writing
styles
and
flair
to
be
close
to
the
specific
style
favored
by
the
ai
grader
.
the
second
-lrb-
and
more
important
-rrb-
omission
that
i
could
see
an
ai
grader
making
is
actual
thematic
and
topical
analysis
of
a
written
paper
.
sure
,
i
'm
certain
ai
could
become
proficient
in
knowing
what
key
words
or
general
arguments
to
accept
for
the
given
essay
prompt
,
but
there
are
thousands
of
ways
to
answer
a
prompt
,
depending
on
how
open
it
is
,
and
an
ai
grader
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
discretion
and
judgement
of
a
human
in
deciding
whether
someone
's
answer
actually
answers
whatever
the
prompt
is
.
students
could
write
gibberish
with
enough
appropriate
key-words
and
trick
the
ai
,
and
students
with
unorthodox
answers
might
get
overlooked
.
the
use
of
ai
helpers
to
let
instructors
take
orders
of
multitude
more
students
in
their
classes
is
treated
as
a
boon
in
the
paper
,
and
while
there
are
of
course
advantages
to
this
,
it
also
means
that
students
now
get
just
fractions
of
the
important
human
attention
that
they
would
have
gotten
from
the
instructor
if
they
had
n't
been
using
a
mooc
.
the
paper
briefly
mentions
but
then
overlooks
the
anti-
social
effects
of
being
in
classes
where
one
interacts
with
more
ai
than
humans
.
overall
it
seems
to
me
that
while
ai
will
have
a
place
in
the
future
of
the
class
-
room
,
there
should
be
high
standards
to
make
sure
it
does
n't
actually
hinder
students
'
attempts
to
learn
.
last
,
i
challenge
this
assignment
's
request
for
us
to
challenge
this
paper
.
while
the
purpose
of
this
assignment
is
apparent
,
it
's
still
a
mostly
fruitless
task
to
ask
students
with
minimal
knowledge
of
ai
to
try
to
challenge
a
paper
written
by
an
entire
team
of
diverse
and
knowledgeable
experts
.
of
course
in
my
challenges
i
try
to
sound
like
i
know
what
i
'm
talking
about
but
i
'm
really
just
making
-lrb-
poorly
-rrb-
educated
guesses
vs.
the
stanford
team
's
research
and
expert
opinions
.
i
do
appreciate
that
this
assignment
got
me
to
think
about
ai
concepts
and
read
the
academic
paper
closely
,
but
i
felt
ingenuine
trying
to
argue
against
points
that
i
actually
agreed
with
for
the
most
part
.
