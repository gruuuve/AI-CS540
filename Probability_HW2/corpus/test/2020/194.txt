in
keeping
with
its
overall
tone
,
the
report
is
generally
optimistic
about
the
potential
for
ai
to
improve
healthcare
in
north
america
.
however
,
it
fails
to
acknowledge
one
important
consideration
:
the
cost
of
implementing
ai
technology
in
healthcare
,
particularly
in
the
united
states
.
given
the
economic
realities
of
american
healthcare
,
the
cost
of
ai
is
likely
to
increase
inequality
and
undo
much
of
the
benefit
that
can
be
gained
;
thus
,
a
comprehensive
assessment
of
the
effect
of
ai
on
healthcare
must
take
its
economic
aspect
into
account
.
the
american
healthcare
system
is
widely
acknowledged
to
be
expensive
and
inefficient
.
compared
to
other
oecd
countries
,
the
us
spends
far
more
per
capita
on
healthcare
-lrb-
2.5
times
the
oecd
average
-rrb-
yet
achieves
below-average
outcomes
on
important
health
indicators
--
life
expectancy
,
obesity
,
access
to
care
,
and
so
on
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
.
while
higher
salaries
for
health
professionals
are
a
contributing
factor
,
so
too
are
the
high
cost
of
medication
and
the
overuse
of
expensive
technologies
such
as
mris
-lrb-
2
-rrb-
.
now
consider
that
modern
machine-learning-based
ai
requires
the
support
of
costly
software
and
-lrb-
especially
-rrb-
hardware
infrastructure
;
in
a
healthcare
system
already
burdened
by
expensive
technology
,
what
will
the
addition
of
yet
more
expensive
technology
do
?
will
using
more
ai
truly
beat
out
the
alternative
of
scaling
back
technology
and
directing
the
savings
toward
more
efficient
uses
?
this
is
n't
merely
a
matter
of
number-crunching
;
the
high
cost
of
american
healthcare
has
a
real
effect
in
exacerbating
economic
disparities
.
in
2016
,
22
%
of
americans
avoided
going
to
the
doctor
due
to
concerns
about
medical
costs
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
,
a
percentage
that
will
only
increase
as
healthcare
becomes
ever
more
expensive
.
thus
,
when
the
report
projects
that
greater
adoption
of
ai
will
improve
patient
outcomes
,
which
patients
will
it
improve
outcomes
for
?
if
only
well-off
patients
benefit
from
ai-assisted
care
while
poorer
patients
are
priced
out
of
the
healthcare
market
completely
,
the
result
can
only
be
increasing
inequality
and
a
further
decline
in
the
overall
health
of
the
nation
.
given
this
possibility
,
the
use
of
ai
technology
must
be
carefully
evaluated
to
make
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
.
to
some
extent
,
the
report
attempts
to
address
the
potential
for
ai
to
widen
existing
economic
inequalities
.
however
,
it
only
does
so
within
the
context
of
bias
in
ai
decision-making
,
and
the
solutions
it
proposes
revolve
around
engineering
training
data
and
models
to
avoid
such
bias
.
in
fact
,
as
the
above-cited
data
shows
,
high
costs
are
just
as
effective
at
promoting
inequality
as
any
inherent
bias
in
ai
.
as
such
,
both
factors
must
be
considered
to
accurately
assess
how
ai
will
influence
inequality
.
of
course
,
the
total
effect
of
emerging
ai
technologies
on
the
cost
of
healthcare
is
difficult
to
predict
.
it
may
well
be
that
ai
will
help
reduce
the
cost
of
care
by
eliminating
inefficiencies
-lrb-
such
as
unnecessary
tests
or
medication
waste
-rrb-
,
reducing
administrative
overhead
,
enabling
economies
of
scale
,
and
promoting
the
transition
from
reactive
to
preventative
care
.
at
the
same
time
,
we
must
recognize
that
these
uncertain
benefits
can
not
be
reaped
without
an
upfront
investment
in
expensive
infrastructure
.
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
a
careful
study
of
the
economic
aspect
of
ai
is
needed
before
any
predictions
can
be
made
regarding
its
potential
benefits
.
