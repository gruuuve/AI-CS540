the
challenges
facing
ai
a
big
idea
throughout
the
report
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
is
that
human
trust
and
acceptance
is
likely
the
leading
hindrances
to
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
advancement
.
however
,
there
may
be
other
major
factors
at
play
,
such
as
quality
,
environmental
hazards
,
and
practicality
.
while
quality
and
practicality
were
addressed
in
the
report
,
i
believe
these
factors
in
addition
to
environmental
concerns
lead
in
slowed
ai
acceptance
rather
than
human
emotion
towards
the
technology
.
throughout
history
,
people
have
been
leery
of
new
technology
,
yet
the
acceptance
rate
seems
fast
.
going
a
few
years
back
,
one
would
never
consider
allowing
any
device
into
the
home
that
listens
to
every
conversation
.
today
,
who
knows
how
many
use
siri
,
google
home
,
or
amazon
alexa
.
this
generation
is
the
most
accepting
generation
towards
technology
than
ever
before
it
.
we
already
trust
technology
with
our
personal
conversations
,
to
online
dating
,
with
our
credit
card
information
,
and
so
much
more
.
this
type
of
technology
is
an
integral
part
of
our
lives
,
and
for
this
reason
,
i
do
not
think
that
lack
of
human
trust
plays
as
significant
a
part
as
the
report
leads
us
to
believe
.
the
trust
issue
with
ai
mostly
stems
from
transportation
and
healthcare
,
more
specifically
,
whether
they
are
more
trustworthy
than
humans
.
i
think
this
case
confuses
quality
and
adaptability
over
trust
.
of
course
,
there
is
a
trust
issue
.
both
humans
and
machines
are
bound
to
make
a
mistake
,
and
generally
machines
make
less
mistakes
.
when
machines
do
make
a
mistake
,
it
is
hard
to
determine
the
blame
.
according
to
the
report
,
liability
issues
are
a
major
problem
in
delicate
situations
that
involve
human
lives
.
still
,
most
people
can
agree
that
machines
are
less
prone
to
exhaustion
,
illness
,
and
mistakes
than
humans
.
they
are
dependable
,
but
they
are
rigid
.
for
transportation
,
people
can
easily
change
route
or
navigate
areas
that
are
not
defined
roads
.
technology
has
not
reached
a
point
yet
where
it
can
replace
the
human
mind
,
and
as
pointed
out
in
the
report
,
it
is
unlikely
that
partial
integration
can
depend
on
constant
human
oversight
.
for
healthcare
,
medical
professionals
have
to
deal
with
long
shifts
and
highly
stressful
situations
.
it
seems
ideal
for
robotic
intervention
,
but
humans
can
compensate
well
for
imperfect
situations
such
as
a
power
outage
,
a
shortage
on
some
supply
,
or
an
error
caused
by
misinformation
that
even
a
robot
could
not
have
predicted
.
lastly
,
a
big
hindrance
to
artificial
intelligence
is
practicality
and
the
environmental
movement
.
artificial
intelligence
,
especially
for
autonomous
vehicles
,
require
a
lot
of
energy
.
autonomous
vehicles
would
require
an
entire
uproot
of
the
existing
infrastructure
and
would
cost
an
incredible
amount
of
money
.
the
investment
aside
,
this
infrastructure
and
healthcare
technology
needs
to
be
supported
with
electricity
around
the
clock
.
today
,
we
are
facing
a
major
environmental
movement
against
many
current
energy
sources
.
renewable
energy
and
energy
storage
is
not
ready
for
large-scale
deployment
,
and
until
then
,
this
movement
persuades
people
to
conserve
energy
,
which
can
not
be
done
if
we
are
adding
electronics
exponentially
to
our
lives
.
