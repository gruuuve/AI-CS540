the
first
point
i
want
to
challenge
is
related
to
healthcare
.
in
the
report
,
it
emphasizes
the
importance
of
human
intervention
during
the
medical
process
.
the
issue
of
trust
between
patients
and
technologies
should
be
considered
.
currently
,
most
people
would
not
trust
a
medical
process
with
the
appearance
of
a
human
doctor
.
in
this
case
,
human
intervention
should
be
added
so
that
the
diagnosis
and
proper
treatment
would
be
accepted
by
patients
.
however
,
the
report
also
states
that
a
human
doctor
is
necessary
for
giving
the
correct
diagnosis
.
this
is
being
overestimated
about
the
ability
of
a
human
doctor
.
take
the
example
from
the
report
,
an
x-ray
image
is
produced
for
a
patient
.
a
human
doctor
would
see
nothing
more
than
a
ai
with
computer
vision
does
.
the
same
lights
and
shapes
would
be
processes
by
both
the
doctor
and
ai
.
when
the
human
doctor
makes
his\/her
judgement
about
the
image
,
there
is
chance
for
human
error
to
occur
:
he\/she
may
overlook
some
part
of
the
image
.
however
,
for
a
well
implemented
and
well
trained
ai
,
this
error
is
nearly
negligible
.
therefore
,
it
is
arguable
that
human
doctors
are
necessary
for
image
judgement
.
ai
would
be
at
least
as
good
as
human
in
this
task
.
moreover
,
human
doctors
sometimes
would
even
give
less
accurate
diagnosis
.
one
doctor
often
specialize
in
one
area
.
it
is
hard
for
doctors
to
make
judgment
while
the
situation
is
complicated
,
involving
multiple
area
.
a
conference
is
often
called
for
such
complicated
cases
.
it
takes
a
long
time
and
hard
to
give
a
good
diagnosis
.
as
for
ai
,
it
can
easily
cover
multiple
area
and
even
build
better
understanding
.
it
is
reasonable
to
say
ai
can
be
better
in
complicated
cases
.
