in
current
world
,
people
are
living
in
technologically
well-developed
world
.
one
of
the
most
trending
technologies
in
these
days
is
artificial
intelligent
.
as
the
report
says
,
ai
is
used
in
many
places
in
human
world
and
it
is
also
influenced
the
way
human
lives
.
moreover
,
people
are
living
their
lives
with
ai
even
though
they
might
not
notice
it
.
currently
,
ai
is
mainly
used
in
some
areas
such
as
transportation
and
entertainment
,
and
those
fields
are
what
people
are
also
focusing
on
.
according
to
the
report
,
google
and
tesla
already
made
self-driven
car
and
google
s
product
has
been
driven
more
than
1,500,000
miles

.
in
the
entertainment
area
,
ai
is
able
to
recognize
and
create
images
of
3d
objects
.
these
effects
of
ai
advances
people
s
lives
.
however
,
these
changes
also
can
bring
some
new
challenges
that
people
have
to
solve
.
first
is
about
safety
and
responsibility
of
car
crash
and
second
challenge
is
abuse
and
misusage
of
ai
in
social
network
services
.
self-driven
car
is
not
completely
free
from
the
car
accident
and
as
it
is
briefly
introduced
in
the
report
,
it
is
ambiguous
that
who
is
in
charge
of
that
car
accident
.
sometimes
people
may
experience
car
crashes
and
when
car
crash
happens
,
judge
makes
a
decision
depends
on
how
accident
happened
and
who
made
a
mistake
.
however
,
if
the
situation
happened
by
a
self-driven
car
,
it
is
vague
who
s
fault
is
it
,
which
makes
difficult
for
judge
to
make
a
judgement
.
driver
is
in
the
car
and
owns
the
car
,
but
with
self-driven
car
s
case
,
driver
does
nothing
with
the
car
.
the
company
which
makes
and
implements
the
system
of
the
car
is
not
present
in
most
of
the
situation
.
safety
also
might
be
controversial
in
the
car
accident
since
when
the
car
accident
happens
,
ai
system
should
decide
what
to
put
in
the
priority
,
would
driver
s
life
will
be
placed
in
higher
priority
or
a
person
who
is
on
the
street
?
if
decision
is
made
by
human
,
it
can
be
acceptable
because
accident
is
unpredictable
,
and
human
can
make
a
mistake
.
however
,
in
self-driven
car
,
the
situation
would
already
be
designed
in
the
system
.
in
the
old
movie
,
i
,
robot
has
similar
situation
.
will
smith
was
in
the
car
accident
with
his
daughter
and
ai
robot
came
to
rescue
them
.
will
told
the
robot
to
save
his
daughter
first
,
but
robot
analyzed
will
is
more
likely
to
survive
,
so
the
robot
rescued
will
instead
of
his
daughter
.
since
in
that
situation
will
thought
that
robot
killed
his
daughter
so
,
he
started
to
hate
the
robots
.
ai
also
can
be
abused
and
misused
by
some
people
by
creating
fake
images
and
spread
them
to
other
people
on
the
social
network
services
.
recently
,
there
was
technology
which
ai
creates
3d
images
of
some
people
and
edit
it
with
another
people
s
video
.
some
people
made
fake
news
of
some
politician
to
cheat
people
on
political
purpose
.
moreover
,
people
also
made
fake
sexual
video
of
popular
actresses
.
as
ai
is
getting
better
and
better
these
days
,
these
kinds
of
offenses
would
be
harder
for
people
to
define
between
real
and
fake
.
