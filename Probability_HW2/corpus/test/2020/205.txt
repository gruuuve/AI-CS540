definition
is
n't
all
the
report
``
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
(2016)
both
academically
and
thoroughly
introduces
the
idea
of
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
,
the
past
era
for
ai
development
,
current
states
,
and
future
trends
.
while
i
agree
upon
most
points
illustrated
in
the
report
,
i
find
the
statement
that
the
lack
of
a
widely
agreed
definition
of
artificial
intelligence
fosters
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
ai
to
be
questionable
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
many
academic
words
or
phrases
lack
universally
accepted
definitions
.
for
example
,
one
of
the
fundamental
concepts
in
biology
--
genetics
--
can
be
defined
in
many
different
ways
depending
on
the
field
of
study
.
it
can
be
defined
by
mendel
's
law
,
by
dna
theories
,
or
even
probability
theories
.
thus
,
since
having
multiple
definitions
is
common
across
the
academia
,
it
can
not
be
argued
that
the
same
phenomenon
has
accelerates
ai
development
.
like
genetics
in
biology
,
the
many
definitions
might
just
be
a
result
of
the
development
.
in
biology
,
mendel
was
the
first
to
come
out
with
idea
of
genetics
.
then
as
microscope
technologies
advances
,
cells
can
be
studied
in
more
details
as
well
as
dna
,
thus
emerging
the
cellular
definition
of
genetics
.
ai
was
introduced
,
and
soon
different
areas
of
study
related
to
ai
emerges
,
each
can
potentially
hold
a
definition
of
ai
.
the
assumption
that
ai
does
lack
a
universal
definition
is
made
in
the
last
paragraph
,
however
,
this
might
not
be
valid
.
when
ai
was
first
introduced
during
a
1956
workshop
at
the
dartmouth
summer
research
project
on
artificial
intelligence
,
the
goal
of
the
workshop
was
to
``
investigate
ways
in
which
machines
could
be
made
to
simulate
aspects
of
intelligence
.
''
this
is
a
very
similar
argument
as
the
definition
given
in
the
article
:
ai
is
devoted
to
make
machines
intelligent
,
such
as
being
able
to
foresee
its
environment
and
function
properly
.
it
shows
that
ai
has
been
defined
when
it
first
came
out
,
and
close
definitions
are
still
being
the
main
trend
definition
.
therefore
,
it
is
fair
to
state
that
ai
does
not
have
as
much
ambiguity
in
definition
as
stated
in
the
report
.
it
is
an
undeniable
truth
that
ai
has
prospered
tremendously
during
the
past
decades
,
but
i
would
argue
that
this
is
because
of
ai
's
strong
association
with
varies
fields
,
and
their
advancements
as
illustrated
in
the
report
,
instead
of
ai
's
potentially
unclear
definition
.
for
example
,
deep
learning
is
largely
influenced
by
the
advancement
in
computer
hardware
from
computer
engineering
which
enables
more
sophisticated
and
accurate
objects
recognition
.
neural
networks
are
formed
on
the
bases
of
neurobiology
and
the
understanding
of
neuronal
signals
.
natural
language
processing
-lrb-
nlp
-rrb-
benefits
from
deeper
understandings
of
languages
in
psychology
and
linguistics
.
large-scale
machine
learning
depends
on
statistics
and
data
science
,
etc.
.
because
of
the
association
of
ai
to
so
many
different
areas
of
studies
,
and
their
fast
development
,
today
's
ai
can
advance
in
such
rapid
pace
.
to
sum
up
,
ai
does
not
have
as
ambiguous
of
a
definition
as
described
in
the
report
,
even
if
it
does
,
it
is
not
the
cause
to
its
prosperity
.
rather
,
it
is
the
prosperity
of
other
subjects
and
the
strength
of
interarea
studies
that
enable
ai
to
its
advancement
today
.
