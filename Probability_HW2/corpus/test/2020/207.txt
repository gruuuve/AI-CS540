i
find
the
topic
of
artificial
intelligence
as
it
relates
to
popular
culture
and
media
quite
fascinating
.
personally
,
my
first
exposure
to
the
concept
of
ai
was
through
the
2004
movie
``
i
,
robot
''
.
ever
since
,
i
have
been
heavily
intrigued
by
the
concept
of
ai
,
whether
it
be
the
hollywood
sci-fi
interpretation
of
ai
or
more
practical
,
real
world
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
.
as
such
,
i
found
the
2015
report
by
the
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
to
be
quite
interesting
to
read
.
i
have
never
had
the
chance
to
consume
such
an
empirical
review
of
the
state
of
real
world
and
future
artificial
intelligence
technologies
.
i
found
myself
in
agreement
with
the
vast
majority
of
this
review
.
furthermore
,
i
found
much
of
what
was
described
to
be
done
so
objectively
,
as
an
impartial
representation
of
the
current
state
of
ai
.
i
did
,
however
,
have
one
main
qualm
with
a
position
that
was
presented
.
my
one
significant
challenge
to
this
review
is
on
the
idea
that
advancing
technology
and
implementation
of
artificial
intelligence
will
almost
certainly
have
merely
a
slow
and
gradual
effect
on
the
employment
of
human
laborers
.
one
of
the
key
ramifications
of
artificial
intelligence
is
its
effect
of
automating
much
work
that
was
once
done
by
humans
.
overall
,
i
strongly
agree
with
most
of
how
this
review
presented
this
issue
.
in
my
opinion
,
the
review
did
a
good
job
illustrating
how
the
``
treasures
''
rewarded
by
ai
should
be
distributed
amongst
us
all
,
although
that
is
decidedly
not
representative
of
the
current
trajectory
.
despite
profound
technological
revelations
,
the
average
consumer
has
benefited
very
little
from
a
perspective
of
wealth
.
new
technologies
will
,
of
course
,
decrease
production
costs
of
goods
,
which
will
then
benefit
the
consumers
,
but
the
amount
of
employment
that
artificial
intelligence
and
automation
threatens
to
replace
could
pose
an
existential
threat
to
the
middle
and
lower
class
.
where
i
strongly
disagree
with
the
review
is
pertaining
to
the
timescale
of
this
employment
obsolescence
.
the
review
argues
-lrb-
with
little
substantiation
-rrb-
that
advancing
ai
implementations
will
likely
cause
very
gradual
changes
in
human
employment
,
and
could
potentially
create
as
many
new
jobs
as
are
displaced
.
i
believe
that
automation
could
manifest
at
a
much
faster
rate
.
in
our
capitalist
society
,
ai
could
be
the
gold
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
as
far
as
productivity
meeting
low
cost
to
corporations
.
as
soon
as
a
practical
implementation
of
ai
is
available
,
corporations
could
conceivably
convert
almost
their
entire
workforce
to
software
,
practically
overnight
.
certainly
this
could
n't
happen
overnight
for
every
company
and
employer
in
the
world
,
but
once
the
technology
is
out
there
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
in
a
matter
of
years
a
profound
amount
of
jobs
could
become
obsolete
.
the
solution
i
would
propose
to
this
problem
would
be
the
implementation
of
a
universal
basic
income
,
one
of
the
suggestions
proposed
in
the
review
itself
.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
as
technology
advances
and
the
total
workload
burdening
humanity
decreases
,
the
benefits
should
be
equally
distributed
across
the
human
race
.
it
should
be
unacceptable
for
the
richest
portion
of
humanity
to
become
richer
and
richer
while
the
middle
and
lower
classes
stagnate
.
for
this
reason
,
i
feel
that
a
universal
basic
income
should
be
implemented
as
soon
as
possible
.
there
is
no
danger
in
acting
too
soon
for
what
is
an
inevitable
dilemma
which
,
if
left
untreated
,
could
destroy
lives
.
this
is
why
i
find
the
position
that
automation-produced
employment
absolution
being
gradual
to
be
naive
in
the
best
case
and
catastrophic
in
the
worst
case
.
