there
is
a
fear
that
ai
can
harm
humanity
in
many
sorts
of
ways
.
the
most
prominent
to
the
average
american
is
seen
in
science
fiction
movies
where
ai
robots
take
over
the
world
and
overthrow
humanity
.
ai
in
its
current
state
does
not
need
to
be
feared
to
the
level
that
movies
portray
.
but
parts
of
ai
bring
up
concern
,
such
as
the
blame
for
an
accident
in
a
self-driving
car
.
due
to
the
rate
that
ai
is
advancing
it
is
difficult
for
policies
and
rules
to
keep
up
.
an
example
of
this
is
how
many
rules
have
been
placed
on
self-driving
cars
;
as
of
2016
only
four
states
in
the
united
state
have
there
been
rules
that
have
addressed
self-driving
cars
.
these
rules
do
not
address
how
a
mistake
should
be
handled
in
a
legal
matter
.
in
states
that
do
not
have
any
rules
that
address
self-driving
cars
the
court
probably
does
not
have
much
of
an
option
to
blame
anyone
but
the
person
in
the
driver
seat
.
as
a
consumer
it
is
hard
to
put
faith
in
an
ai
car
that
you
could
have
little
control
over
that
could
potentially
send
you
to
jail
.
instead
of
wanting
ai
to
slow
down
in
progressing
,
it
would
be
beneficial
for
everyone
if
policy
makers
could
speed
up
legislation
.
ai
has
shown
large
benefits
in
self-driving
vehicles
with
how
safe
they
are
,
but
it
is
hard
to
progress
if
the
consumer
has
a
hard
time
placing
their
faith
in
the
product
due
to
the
lack
of
knowing
whether
they
would
be
to
blame
if
the
ai
car
were
to
make
a
mistake
.
one
area
of
concern
for
ai
is
in
the
field
of
education
.
although
it
may
seem
like
a
good
idea
for
a
super
genius
``
teaching
robot
''
to
teach
the
children
of
america
,
they
will
not
be
able
to
provide
children
with
the
skills
that
they
require
in
life
.
ai
robots
may
have
the
potential
to
teach
students
more
accurately
than
teachers
do
;
but
they
will
not
be
able
to
provide
the
nurture
that
young
children
require
to
develop
into
functional
adults
.
children
need
interaction
with
both
peers
and
adult
``
parent
''
like
figures
to
gain
social
skills
for
their
future
.
being
able
to
use
intelligence
gained
in
school
requires
skills
that
only
a
human
being
would
be
able
to
give
to
their
child
.
maybe
with
enough
research
into
teaching
robots
could
be
used
in
upper
level
classes
such
as
senior
classes
in
high
school
and
college
classes
,
where
the
student
does
not
need
as
much
nurture
to
develop
fully
as
a
young
person
does
.
another
concern
may
be
the
fairness
in
education
that
children
get
.
with
new
ai
technologies
that
come
out
some
schools
may
get
less
in
taxpayers
'
money
and
``
fancier
''
schools
may
get
more
because
the
alure
of
smarter
students
.
this
could
harm
certain
populations
of
children
more
,
further
increasing
the
gap
in
wealth
in
america
.
although
i
do
not
think
ai
should
be
used
for
teaching
robots
at
lower
levels
of
education
,
ai
can
be
used
for
many
positives
in
education
,
such
as
helpful
analytics
and
data
gathering
.
there
can
be
some
negatives
in
ai
but
i
holistically
think
that
ai
is
changing
the
world
for
the
better
and
we
should
keep
advancing
and
improving
ai
technology
as
fast
as
possible
.
