the
notion
of
autonomous
vehicles
is
no
longer
surreal
but
real
in
the
sky
,
sea
,
and
even
on
mars
.
this
notion
has
yet
to
become
a
reality
on
the
land
.
although
the
report
of
the
2015
study
panel
hopes
that
with
the
advent
of
new
complex
algorithms
for
advanced
perception
would
make
self-driving
cars
a
norm
;
however
,
i
believe
that
self-driving
must
pass
through
a
spate
of
hurdles
that
i
do
not
see
happening
in
2030
.
one
of
the
biggest
problems
faced
by
self-driving
cars
is
technological
errors
,
no
piece
of
software
that
exists
in
the
current
world
is
error-free
and
human
casualties
are
a
near
certainty
.
a
big
challenge
faced
in
such
situations
by
ai
models
is
the
concept
of
moral
dilemmas
;
often
referred
to
as
the
trolley
problem
,
when
faced
by
a
situation
where
the
ai
model
has
to
choose
between
3
possible
situation
where
none
is
the
right
solution
,
what
will
it
choose
.
these
3
situations
all
place
a
value
on
human
existence
and
offers
this
immense
power
to
deny
or
accept
life
to
an
existence
that
is
not
alive
itself
and
can
not
quantify
the
value
of
life
.
moreover
ai
in
the
deepest
sense
is
not
true
intelligence
as
it
is
claimed
to
be
but
is
at
best
a
series
of
interconnected
patterns
being
processed
at
an
extremely
high
rate
to
give
an
illusion
of
intelligence
as
a
paradigm
,
at
best
this
intelligence
can
be
compared
to
the
intelligence
of
a
worm
wiggling
around
in
the
dirt
aimlessly
.
there
is
a
very
specific
reason
why
major
tests
for
self-driving
cars
are
performed
in
phoenix
,
arizona
:
the
tests
are
done
on
the
some
of
the
finest
roads
in
america
.
developed
infrastructure
is
always
crucial
for
better
navigation
of
self-driving
.
for
instance
,
beaten
down
roads
and
improper
geographical
map
grid
in
some
developing
countries
are
a
major
navigation
problem
for
human
drivers
,
and
it
would
be
even
more
difficult
for
self-driving
cars
.
moreover
,
with
global
warming
brewing
and
stirring
more
natural
disasters
and
bizarre
weather
conditions
,
self-driving
cars
need
exceptional
computer
vision
algorithms
to
navigate
itself
through
buffeting
snowstorm
,
or
heavy
rain
.
no
matter
how
advanced
the
perception
algorithm
of
a
self-driving
car
,
there
no
chance
that
it
would
drive
safely
or
recognize
its
path
with
highest
level
of
accuracy
.
self-driven
cars
have
almost
no
sense
of
rules
and
regulations
that
change
from
state
to
state
,
implementing
this
change
of
regulations
will
be
a
nightmare
as
it
will
require
a
new
ai
model
to
be
implemented
to
fit
the
new
set
of
constraints
,
moreover
this
new
set
of
changes
will
require
an
almost
seamless
update
from
the
previous
ai
model
to
the
new
ai
model
,
any
errors
in
this
update
,
any
lags
can
cause
anything
from
minor
delays
to
major
traffic
accidents
,
moreover
to
implement
this
way
of
multiple
ai
models
could
only
be
feasibly
done
by
large
conglomerates
like
google
,
thus
giving
them
more
power
as
a
corporation
which
as
we
historically
know
is
not
one
of
the
best
idea
.
to
sum
up
,
i
feel
that
there
would
be
a
stark
improvement
in
technology
used
by
self-driving
cars
,
but
to
completely
replace
traditional
cars
it
would
take
many
more
decades
.
