the
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
report
by
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
study
panel
gives
an
excellent
overview
to
artificial
intelligence
,
development
in
the
field
as
well
as
discusses
the
future
of
ai
and
its
's
impact
on
eight
key
sectors
of
society
--
transportation
,
home\/service
robots
,
healthcare
,
education
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
and
security
,
employment
and
workplace
,
entertainment
.
while
artificial
intelligence
is
certainly
a
revolutionary
tool
that
can
drastically
improve
technology
and
our
lives
,
there
have
been
several
incidents
related
to
bias
in
artificial
intelligence
and
its
applications
such
as
facial
recognition
that
question
its
ethics
.
the
report
repeatedly
states
that
ai
itself
can
be
used
to
detect
and
handle
human
biases
and
discrimination
in
application
of
artificial
intelligence
,
however
,
it
never
clearly
discusses
how
such
a
feat
may
be
accomplished
.
it
simply
assumes
that
artificial
intelligence
is
the
straightforward
answer
to
every
question
and
this
assumption
can
lead
developers
to
build
solutions
that
have
detrimental
effects
on
people
,
especially
those
who
are
marginalized
and
do
not
have
the
ability
to
influence
technology
.
recently
,
there
have
been
several
incidents
where
artificial
intelligence
has
failed
to
recognize
faces
of
african
americans
,
especially
women
and
even
falsely
identifying
28
members
of
congress
as
having
been
previous
arrested
.
on
one
occasion
,
google
's
facial
recognition
system
falsely
recognized
an
african
american
woman
as
a
gorilla
.
there
have
also
been
several
cases
where
people
of
color
have
been
subjected
to
unjust
discrimination
in
judicial
systems
based
on
their
skin
color
.
these
biases
are
present
in
several
ai
systems
and
are
indeed
integral
parts
of
the
datasets
that
are
used
to
construct
these
systems
.
while
the
authors
of
the
report
are
hopeful
that
artificial
intelligence
can
be
used
to
remove
these
very
biases
,
they
must
also
recognize
that
there
are
many
implicit
factors
and
prejudice
ingrained
in
the
human
psyche
that
will
most
certainly
creep
into
the
new
ai
that
will
be
meant
to
detect
biases
.
this
will
form
a
vicious
cycle
as
there
will
always
be
aspects
of
the
human
mind
that
can
not
be
predicted
or
understood
.
the
best
course
of
action
in
this
scenario
is
to
limit
the
use
of
ai
in
applications
where
ethical
values
and
human
life
are
concerned
.
human
judgement
will
probably
be
best
and
the
consequences
and
blame
for
managing
mistakes
can
be
resolved
using
current
systems
of
law
and
judiciary
.
lastly
,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
authors
of
the
report
state
that
``
government
bodies
trying
to
balance
their
budgets
in
light
of
advances
in
ai
may
pass
legislations
to
slow
or
alter
the
course
of
the
technology
''
.
on
the
other
hand
,
i
believe
that
governments
are
the
primary
customers
for
ai-enabled
technology
.
through
ai
innovations
in
education
,
transportation
,
military
and
surveillance
technology
,
the
government
has
the
most
to
gain
as
it
will
need
to
employ
less
people
for
these
tasks
and
can
efficiently
penalize
offenders
as
well
as
tax
usage
of
services
such
as
transportation
.
thus
,
governments
will
be
the
first
-lrb-
and
most
important
-rrb-
forces
to
support
the
rise
of
ai
technology
and
will
likely
pass
legislations
that
foster
its
growth
.
while
it
is
true
that
there
may
be
less
income
tax
collected
due
to
increased
unemployment
,
more
innovative
taxation
systems
can
make
up
for
any
lost
revenue
.
thus
,
while
ai
has
its
great
advantages
,
it
also
has
significant
disadvantages
and
ethical
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
while
discussing
its
widespread
use
.
moreover
,
governments
,
often
seen
as
barriers
to
adoption
to
ai
,
can
be
the
greatest
beneficiaries
from
the
technology
.
