in
the
article
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
there
were
many
innovative
ideas
about
the
future
of
ai
and
what
comes
along
with
advances
in
ai
technology
.
along
with
this
technology
,
there
are
a
lot
of
political
ideals
that
need
to
be
discussed
in
order
for
a
smooth
transition
into
an
ai
world
.
the
article
states
that
there
needs
to
be
``
a
path
toward
accruing
technical
expertise
in
ai
at
all
levels
of
government
,
and
effective
governance
also
requires
more
experts
who
understand
and
can
analyze
the
interactions
between
ai
technologies
,
programmatic
objectives
,
and
overall
societal
values
.
''
(43)
.
i
feel
that
the
notion
that
experts
should
be
responsible
for
the
policies
in
their
field
is
like
a
double
edged
sword
.
on
one
hand
,
they
are
the
most
educated
in
their
area
and
know
exactly
what
these
policies
will
do
to
improve
the
industry
,
but
on
the
other
hand
they
can
use
this
power
to
create
some
loopholes
for
companies
to
breakthrough
and
take
advantage
of
.
those
that
are
in
the
driver
's
seat
when
it
comes
to
ai
policies
will
dictate
the
future
of
the
industry
,
which
could
be
taken
advantage
of
and
i
argue
that
there
needs
to
be
some
baseline
regulations
for
either
companies
or
those
in
the
government
themselves
to
check
their
power
.
the
article
takes
the
perspective
that
``
faced
with
the
profound
changes
that
ai
technologies
can
produce
,
pressure
for
``
more
''
and
``
tougher
''
regulation
is
probably
inevitable
,
''
(10)
.
this
perspective
is
definitely
possible
and
they
justify
less
regulation
of
the
ai
sphere
by
claiming
companies
would
be
encouraged
to
use
privacy
control
,
best
practices
,
and
engage
with
outside
stakeholders
when
less
strict
rules
are
placed
on
them
(10)
.
i
agree
with
this
sentiment
,
but
when
rules
are
minimally
introduced
there
are
two
possible
outcomes
.
one
,
in
which
companies
wanting
to
profit
will
find
loopholes
and
scam
the
system
or
two
there
is
an
actual
compliance
with
the
system
in
place
.
in
the
modern
day
,
i
do
n't
have
much
trust
within
the
top
ceo
's
of
all
of
these
companies
not
to
want
to
take
the
ai
revolution
to
their
side
.
so
,
when
these
``
experts
''
start
consulting
with
the
government
about
policies
for
ai
there
needs
to
be
a
major
check
within
the
system
in
order
to
assure
that
no
government
employee
or
insider
is
taking
advantage
of
this
new
space
for
policy
.
insiders
in
the
fossil
fuel
industry
have
basically
influenced
american
politics
for
the
last
century
and
are
continuing
to
fund
government
candidates
in
order
to
profit
even
more
,
and
deny
that
they
are
causing
harm
to
the
world
.
i
just
do
n't
want
that
to
happen
with
ai
where
facts
are
misrepresented
and
large
companies
start
using
ai
in
circumstances
that
the
article
regarded
like
``
gerrymandering
and
targeted
``
robocalls
''
designed
to
suppress
voters
''
(48)
.
other
parts
of
the
government
also
might
try
to
influence
ai
policies
in
a
negative
light
,
such
as
those
who
rely
on
parking\/speeding
tickets
that
could
become
null
and
void
if
automated
cars
are
able
to
always
abide
by
the
law
.
these
industries
would
also
need
to
be
regulated
or
surveyed
as
to
not
interfere
with
a
fair
future
for
ai
.
