artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
or
ai
-rrb-
has
been
coined
by
many
as
being
at
the
center
of
the
4th
industrial
revolution
or
the
technology
revolution
.
the
first
report
of
the
100
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
was
published
in
september
2016
.
since
then
,
there
have
been
some
incremental
developments
in
the
field
of
ai
which
help
us
get
a
small
idea
on
the
pace
at
which
the
technology
is
developing
.
transportation
has
been
an
area
where
there
has
been
the
most
progress
.
with
tesla
at
the
forefront
,
many
automobile
companies
have
rolled
out
a
slew
of
cars
that
have
self-driving
capabilities
.
in
late
2019
,
tesla
released
a
smart
summon
feature
for
its
high-end
cars
allowing
a
car
to
automatically
drive
to
the
car-owner
from
its
parking
space
.
however
,
other
areas
have
been
slow
to
see
the
fruits
of
ai
.
healthcare
is
an
area
where
ai
has
found
it
tough
to
make
an
impact
on
at
the
consumer
level
.
among
others
,
one
of
the
main
reasons
it
is
difficult
to
implement
an
ai
program
in
healthcare
is
the
strict
rules
and
regulations
that
hospitals
and
clinics
have
to
abide
by
regarding
ownership
of
a
patient
s
data
.
that
is
why
i
want
to
challenge
the
author
s
prediction
that
in
the
coming
decades
``
ai
advances
coupled
with
sufficient
data
and
well
targeted
systems
is
poised
to
the
change
the
cognitive
tasks
assigned
to
human
clinicians
''
-lrb-
2016
report
-rrb-
.
the
author
foresees
a
future
where
instead
of
the
human
clinician
diagnosing
a
patient
s
disease
based
on
the
patient
verbally
communicating
the
symptoms
,
there
will
be
an
ai
powered
device
where
the
patient
can
input
his\/her
symptoms
and
ai
can
predict
the
disease
.
however
,
there
are
many
factors
that
have
to
be
considered
while
making
predictions
about
medical
conditions
.
for
this
supposed
ai
device
to
work
,
it
will
require
to
have
access
to
a
person
s
medical
records
to
be
able
to
make
an
accurate
prediction
on
their
condition
.
however
,
there
are
strong
institutions
in
place
that
protect
a
patient
s
data
and
privacy
.
medical
data
and
records
are
private
information
that
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
an
individual
,
from
employment
to
insurance
.
the
author
throughout
this
passage
has
referred
to
the
``
outdated
regulations
and
structural
barriers
''
-lrb-
2016
report
-rrb-
and
named
those
as
the
reasons
why
the
power
of
ai
has
been
unrealized
in
the
healthcare
industry
specifically
in
the
clinical
setting
.
however
,
i
strongly
believe
that
healthcare
is
the
prime
example
of
how
each
industry
should
establish
strong
rules
by
which
applications
of
ai
should
abide
by
.
in
the
recent
meeting
of
the
world
economic
forum
at
davos
,
alphabet
ceo
sundar
pichai
stated
that
to
reap
positive
benefits
of
ai
as
a
society
there
has
to
be
a
strong
groundwork
that
needs
to
be
laid
and
rules
that
need
to
be
followed
so
that
the
use
of
ai
is
fair
and
protects
the
right
to
privacy
of
all
people
.
the
report
does
a
good
job
of
exploring
the
possibilities
of
ai
in
healthcare
.
although
vague
,
it
mentions
a
broad
variety
of
applications
of
ai
in
different
sectors
such
as
clinics
,
home
care
and
mobile
care
.
however
,
the
approach
of
the
paper
towards
traditional
regulations
makes
it
harder
to
agree
on
some
of
the
deadlines
and
possibilities
of
ai
in
various
fields
.
making
breakthrough
in
the
research
labs
is
the
first
task
,
but
making
a
positive
impact
with
consumer
products
that
abide
by
the
laws
is
the
ultimate
goal
.
