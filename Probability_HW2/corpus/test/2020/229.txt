reflection
with
the
recent
innovations
from
amazon
and
uber
,
home
robots
seem
to
be
on
the
verge
of
being
a
staple
in
every
person
's
household
.
according
to
the
paper
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
these
household
robots
will
be
extremely
powerful
compared
to
past
technology
due
to
their
purpose
of
machine
learning
in
a
dynamic
human
environment
and
will
be
widely
accepted
by
people
into
their
homes
in
the
next
decade
.
with
similar
technology
such
as
amazon
's
alexa
and
irobots
's
``
roomba
''
already
being
fairly
common
in
households
.
a
new
integration
of
smarter
and
more
useful
robots
into
the
homes
of
many
,
may
seem
like
a
good
idea
(25)
.
people
in
the
future
that
accept
the
new
robots
into
their
homes
will
be
at
an
advantage
to
those
who
are
sceptical
and
refuse
to
get
themselves
decked
out
with
the
newest
person
robot
,
whether
it
be
privacy
concerns
or
the
cost
of
the
robots
.
from
an
economic
standpoint
this
could
massively
distance
the
rich
from
the
poor
to
the
point
where
life
is
almost
unrecognizable
when
comparing
the
two
.
imagine
coming
home
too
cooked
and
prepared
food
every
night
,
washed
clothes
,
an
unloaded
dishwasher
and
pretty
much
every
other
common
and
uncommon
household
chore
finished
,
all
available
for
a
price
cheaper
than
human
labor
,
but
not
cheap
enough
where
the
majority
of
the
population
benefits
.
someone
currently
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
may
see
an
increase
in
their
job
's
workload
due
to
the
ease
of
life
for
everyone
around
them
,
only
to
not
have
the
extra
time
all
the
other
people
around
them
are
benefiting
from
due
to
the
integration
of
pricy
robots
into
their
homes
.
this
situation
is
one
of
many
that
could
arise
from
the
normalization
of
robotics
into
the
household
.
the
households
that
are
able
to
install
these
types
of
robots
may
be
at
risk
of
a
privacy
invasion
by
either
third
parties
or
the
manufacturers
themselves
.
currently
social
media
and
internet
banking
are
already
two
good
examples
of
where
privacy
and
technology
have
seen
some
conflict
.
with
the
common
idea
of
integrating
service
robots
into
people
's
homes
that
have
deep
machine
learning
algorithms
that
either
map
a
home
or
a
person
's
routine
in
order
to
serve
them
properly
are
collecting
lots
of
personal
data
.
although
there
will
be
many
technological
advances
in
privacy
there
will
also
be
many
technological
advances
in
cybercrime
and
some
of
these
advances
may
be
undetected
until
it
's
too
late
and
someone
has
been
seriously
affected
.
what
will
people
blame
for
this
as
a
result
?
artificial
intelligence
.
this
will
setback
the
topic
for
many
years
as
funding
will
be
cut
and
demand
will
go
down
.
having
a
personal
robot
integrated
into
a
home
or
just
wandering
it
will
cause
paranoia
in
many
,
due
to
personal
privacy
being
at
risk
.
allowing
people
,
rather
than
artificial
intelligence
,
to
have
much
more
control
over
their
own
lives
seems
like
the
safer
option
for
now
as
artificial
intelligence
still
gets
normalized
within
the
common
population
.
overall
the
advances
in
artificial
intelligence
over
the
next
decade
will
need
to
be
slowly
introduced
into
people
's
lives
,
without
a
massive
influx
of
personal
home
robots
flooding
the
market
and
being
introduced
into
people
's
everyday
life
.
this
will
avoid
separating
buyers
from
those
who
are
n't
for
artificial
intellgeince
's
integration
into
home
life
and
will
put
their
ignorance
to
the
test
by
handing
over
the
information
of
their
day-to-day
