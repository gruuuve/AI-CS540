ai
and
transportation
we
are
witnessing
a
boom
like
never
before
.
words
like
artificial
intelligence
,
machine
learning
,
deep
learning
,
and
data
science
are
being
flung
around
unsparingly
in
professional
and
academic
spheres
.
this
copious
usage
and
the
broadness
that
is
implied
in
the
term
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
makes
it
hard
to
define
.
but
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
has
defined
ai
as
that
activity
devoted
to
making
machines
intelligent
,
and
intelligence
is
that
quality
that
enables
an
entity
to
function
appropriately
and
with
foresight
in
its
environment
.
over
the
next
several
years
,
ai
research
,
systems
development
,
and
social
and
regulatory
frameworks
will
shape
how
the
benefits
of
ai
are
weighed
against
its
costs
and
risks
,
and
how
broadly
these
benefits
are
spread
.
one
major
domain
that
the
report
elaborates
on
is
how
the
field
of
transportation
has
been
revolutionized
by
techniques
in
ai
that
are
creating
better
autonomous
vehicles
.
however
,
i
would
like
to
argue
against
the
report
s
claim
that
ai
applications
will
extend
to
trucks
,
flying
vehicles
,
and
personalized
robots
.
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
lack
of
accountability
for
such
a
vehicle
s
actions
,
a
concern
that
has
not
been
addressed
properly
in
the
report
.
the
2018
action-thriller
movie
upgrade
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
movie
that
gives
us
a
glimpse
into
the
morbid
-lrb-
yet
exaggerated
-rrb-
ramifications
of
artificial
intelligence
.
the
movie
depicts
an
intelligent
chip
implanted
in
the
human
brain
accessing
autonomous
cars
and
causing
such
cars
to
behave
and
very
erratic
ways
.
in
the
movie
,
for
example
,
the
implanted
chip
causes
the
autonomous
car
to
accelerate
and
collide
into
a
pole
,
killing
the
inhabitants
of
the
car
.
such
a
situation
is
implausible
,
but
such
a
depiction
can
be
used
to
predict
any
unintended
consequences
of
ai
.
the
report
tackles
this
disadvantage
by
suggesting
the
use
of
semi-autonomous
vehicles
.
despite
being
cautious
in
its
optimism
for
the
future
of
autonomous
cars
,
the
authors
of
the
committee
still
predicted
its
success
,
saying
that
self-driving
cars
will
be
widely
adopted
by
2020
.
having
entered
2020
,
we
know
that
this
is
an
incorrect
prediction
.
this
can
be
attributed
to
a
lack
of
clear-cutting
evidence
that
autonomous
cars
are
worthy
replacements
of
normal
vehicles
.
the
report
misses
the
point
that
even
though
autonomous
cars
have
shown
to
reduce
accidents
caused
by
human
errors
,
this
is
not
enough
to
outweigh
the
disadvantage
of
the
lack
of
accountability
for
these
autonomous
cars
.
in
other
words
,
even
though
accidents
caused
by
autonomous
cars
will
be
less
-lrb-
and
maybe
even
less
serious
-rrb-
,
these
accidents
will
be
heavily
scrutinized
by
various
institutions
in
society
,
like
the
media
and
governing
bodies
.
after
all
,
the
burden
of
responsibility
will
shift
to
the
automobile
companies
and
not
the
aggressor
of
automobile
accidents
.
the
report
also
talks
about
flying
vehicles
by
2030
.
there
are
many
barriers
to
overcome
before
this
becomes
a
reality
.
the
report
talks
about
flying
vehicles
in
isolation
and
does
not
consider
any
sort
of
environmental
disturbances
.
for
example
,
how
is
aerial
wildlife
going
to
be
affected
if
flying
cars
start
using
the
stratosphere
?
the
report
is
quite
mum
on
any
sort
of
environmental
effects
whatsoever
.
but
there
is
one
thing
that
the
report
got
correct
:
ai
is
a
continuously
growing
field
,
and
we
have
only
that
information
that
predicts
the
future
of
artificial
intelligence
based
on
the
current
state
.
who
knows
how
the
definition
of
ai
will
change
in
the
future
?
we
can
only
wait
and
watch
.
