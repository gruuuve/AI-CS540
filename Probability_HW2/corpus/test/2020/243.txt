in
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
's
paper
,
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
published
in
2016
,
many
aspects
of
artificial
intelligence
's
role
in
society
are
discussed
.
the
roles
are
mainly
categorized
into
eight
unique
groups
,
one
of
which
being
transportation
.
it
is
the
predicted
future
development
of
this
group
that
i
remain
unconvinced
of
after
reading
the
paper
.
it
is
proposed
by
the
authors
,
that
the
existence
of
automated
-lrb-
self-driving
-rrb-
cars
will
cause
a
rapid
acceptance
of
this
method
of
travel
.
that
,
in
the
inevitable
societal
adoption
of
the
self-driving
car
,
many
benefits
will
be
reaped
,
ranging
from
fewer
accidents
to
less
traffic
to
people
living
further
away
from
their
jobs
.
however
,
it
appears
as
though
the
reader
is
just
expected
to
believe
this
.
armed
with
the
information
of
an
additional
4
-
5
years
of
development
in
the
industry
,
i
believe
that
the
proposed
grand
scale
changes
and
benefits
that
are
apparently
nigh
inevitable
are
actually
somewhat
over
idealistic
and
unrealistic
.
one
of
the
major
claims
that
is
made
is
that
self
driving
cars
will
allow
for
workers
to
live
farther
away
from
their
places
of
work
,
and
will
reduce
traffic
.
however
,
this
is
somewhat
absurd
to
me
,
as
distance
to
your
place
of
work
is
not
usually
just
because
you
feel
too
lazy
to
drive
that
far
.
the
farther
away
a
worker
lives
from
their
job
,
the
more
they
are
forced
to
pay
for
gas
just
to
get
to
their
job
,
and
the
longer
the
actual
drive
takes
.
the
fact
that
your
car
would
drive
for
you
does
nothing
to
solve
these
factors
,
and
even
if
it
did
,
cars
are
pollution
factories
.
with
the
current
state
of
the
climate
we
should
be
trying
to
focus
our
energy
on
reducing
our
carbon
emission
,
not
increasing
it
.
in
addition
,
the
idea
that
self
driving
cars
will
reduce
traffic
is
frankly
absurd
.
traffic
is
a
result
of
load
of
cars
versus
capacity
of
roads
.
in
order
to
solve
this
,
a
backend
api
would
be
needed
to
sync
up
all
people
using
gps
devices
to
drive
.
this
would
allow
for
an
ai
to
determine
what
routes
to
send
cars
on
in
order
to
evenly
spread
out
loads
,
thereby
effectively
ensuring
the
least
amount
of
traffic
possible
.
a
car
that
drives
itself
has
no
way
of
solving
complex
traffic
problems
,
because
that
's
not
what
it
's
designed
to
do
,
and
rightfully
so
.
the
other
major
idea
is
that
these
self
driving
cars
will
be
magically
accepted
by
the
general
populace
.
this
prediction
does
hold
up
better
than
the
previous
two
mentioned
,
as
demonstrated
by
tesla
's
autopilot
feature
.
however
,
this
feature
still
requires
the
attention
of
the
driver
to
act
in
case
of
a
failure
.
i
believe
it
will
take
quite
some
time
before
anyone
is
completely
willing
to
trust
a
fully
automated
car
,
and
much
more
legislature
needs
to
be
put
in
place
,
as
the
paper
stated
.
while
i
do
n't
believe
that
the
future
of
ai
in
transportation
is
as
idealistic
as
the
paper
seemed
to
imply
,
i
do
believe
that
it
does
have
a
future
.
however
,
there
will
definitely
need
to
be
a
lot
of
changes
before
this
can
be
achieved
.
