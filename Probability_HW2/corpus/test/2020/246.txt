nowadays
,
one
of
the
most
popular
topic
all
over
the
world
is
the
artificial
intelligence
.
people
discuss
about
the
benefit
and
disadvantage
of
the
ai
.
moreover
,
many
people
are
concerned
about
the
abuse
of
artificial
intelligence
after
they
watch
some
of
the
scientific
movies
in
which
ai
do
harm
to
the
human
society
.
according
to
the
article
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
which
is
report
for
a
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
the
author
mention
that
in
the
future
ai
will
be
widely
used
in
many
field
including
transportation
,
home\/service
robots
,
healthcare
,
education
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
and
security
,
employment
and
workplace
and
entertainment
.
although
the
author
mentions
both
the
advantage
of
using
ai
to
improve
our
life
and
some
problem
of
artificial
intelligence
which
still
need
to
solve
,
and
most
of
them
is
comfortable
for
me
and
enrich
my
ai
knowledge
,
there
is
still
some
points
of
which
i
disagree
with
the
author
.
accordingly
,
the
author
mentions
that
car
using
artificial
intelligence
and
peer-to-peer
transportation
services
will
decline
people
s
willing
to
own
a
private
vehicle
.
he
argues
that
the
availability
of
shared
transportations
may
replace
the
public
transportations
.
people
will
use
shared
transportations
such
as
self-driving
car
instead
of
private
car
to
go
to
work
.
at
first
glance
,
the
author
s
argument
appears
to
be
somewhat
convincing
,
but
further
reflection
reveals
that
it
omits
some
substantial
concern
that
should
be
addressed
to
substantiate
the
argument
.
in
my
point
of
view
,
the
citizen
who
can
drive
the
car
and
used
to
own
a
private
car
will
still
buy
a
self-driving
car
in
the
future
.
since
the
ai
driven
car
makes
their
travel
more
convenient
.
in
this
case
,
the
number
of
private
car
will
not
be
decrease
by
the
development
of
self-driven
car
.
moreover
for
those
who
can
not
drive
a
car
nowadays
,
and
for
those
who
can
afford
a
self-driven
car
,
if
the
ai
driven
are
reliable
enough
for
them
to
travel
along
,
i
believe
that
they
are
likely
to
buy
a
private
car
.
since
ai
driven
car
can
improve
their
life
by
allow
them
to
hang
out
whenever
they
want
without
troubling
others
and
take
a
uber
.
in
this
way
,
self-driven
car
provide
them
more
freedom
.
because
of
this
reason
,
the
number
of
private
will
not
decrease
as
the
author
illustrate
in
the
article
,
instead
the
number
of
the
ai
driven
car
will
increase
to
a
huge
amount
if
the
technology
of
artificial
intelligence
are
mature
enough
to
support
the
transportation
.
moreover
,
as
the
number
of
the
self-driven
car
increase
,
the
traffic
problem
in
this
days
and
ages
will
more
even
more
serious
than
before
.
in
this
case
,
more
issue
need
to
be
solve
such
as
transportation
planning
as
the
author
mentioned
in
the
article
by
using
artificial
intelligence
to
calculate
the
best
way
to
arrange
the
transportation
.
as
for
the
point
that
these
shared
transportations
will
replace
the
public
transportation
,
i
disagree
with
it
.
since
there
is
some
obvious
difference
between
shared
transportations
and
public
one
.
the
most
important
feature
of
public
transportation
is
it
cost
people
less
money
.
moreover
,
as
i
mention
before
when
the
number
of
ai
driven
car
increase
the
traffic
problem
will
be
more
serious
.
in
this
case
,
in
order
to
safe
time
public
transportation
still
play
an
important
role
in
people
s
life
.
to
sum
up
,
the
application
of
ai
in
transportation
is
inspiring
,
but
there
is
still
a
lot
of
problems
need
to
be
solve
before
artificial
intelligence
come
into
use
.
