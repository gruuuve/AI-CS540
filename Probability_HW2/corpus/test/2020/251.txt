the
``
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
report
provided
great
insight
into
how
ai
has
already
affected
our
daily
lives
,
where
we
can
see
ai
going
in
the
near
future
,
and
some
of
the
obstacles
that
stand
in
the
way
of
its
advancement
.
in
this
review
,
however
,
there
are
a
couple
of
points
that
deserve
some
further
analysis
.
these
are
first
the
early
postulation
that
the
rise
of
a
superhuman
robotics
race
may
not
even
be
possible
,
and
the
second
is
the
assertion
that
ai
will
continue
to
grow
in
the
continuous
way
that
it
has
shown
to
grow
in
the
past
.
while
these
hypotheses
may
be
founded
on
solid
evidence
of
how
the
growth
of
this
field
has
behaved
in
the
past
,
they
pose
a
serious
threat
to
society
if
they
are
used
to
blindfold
us
to
the
ramifications
that
are
indeed
possible
.
early
on
,
this
report
shunned
the
idea
that
we
might
accidentally
develop
a
dangerous
and
competitive
robotic
enemy
,
and
even
hinted
at
the
farcicality
of
such
an
idea
.
although
worrying
about
the
potential
harm
of
a
possibly
malicious
ai
may
be
a
long
way
away
-lrb-
developmentally
speaking
-rrb-
,
with
the
ever-increasing
rate
of
technological
advancement
,
it
is
very
possible
that
something
harmfully
unexpected
could
emanate
from
pursuing
ai
advancement
far
quicker
than
projected
.
this
groupthink
mentality
of
ignoring
something
with
such
drastic
consequences
borders
on
ignorance
,
and
to
suggest
that
it
may
be
impossible
is
simply
preposterous
given
that
this
mindset
has
been
proven
wrong
time
and
time
again
in
the
past
.
second
,
this
report
suggests
that
ai
technologies
will
continue
on
the
path
of
improving
in
continual
,
incremental
ways
.
while
this
may
be
a
logical
assumption
founded
on
historical
evidence
,
there
have
been
many
technological
innovations
that
have
completely
revolutionized
the
paradigm
of
everyday
life
in
a
rapidly
short
time
.
the
most
obvious
of
these
was
the
origin
of
the
internet
,
which
allowed
people
all
over
the
world
access
to
practically
limitless
data
.
this
is
an
example
of
a
near
stepwise
increase
in
technology
that
had
drastic
implications
on
many
aspects
of
society
,
and
because
of
examples
like
this
,
it
may
not
be
wise
to
suggest
that
ai
technologies
will
always
develop
in
a
continuous
manner
.
this
also
goes
hand-in-hand
with
the
first
critique
;
if
it
is
assumed
that
this
technology
is
always
going
to
evolve
in
a
continuous
and
predictable
manner
,
a
rapid
advancement
may
come
along
that
defies
that
expectation
.
if
we
are
not
prepared
for
that
,
progressions
may
arise
that
can
lead
to
detrimental
effects
to
society
due
to
the
lack
of
time
and
consideration
that
is
given
to
their
consequences
.
nevertheless
,
this
review
does
impose
the
importance
of
lowering
our
guard
as
a
society
to
the
integration
of
artificial
intelligence
further
into
our
daily
lives
.
the
concept
of
ai
holds
incredible
opportunity
for
improving
countless
domains
,
especially
the
eight
that
were
analyzed
,
and
avoiding
unnecessary
roadblocks
will
be
crucial
to
seeing
significant
progress
in
the
field
.
this
report
attempts
to
push
this
ideology
to
the
extreme
in
the
hopes
of
avoiding
this
,
but
we
as
a
society
must
always
be
cognizant
to
the
fact
that
being
too
steadfast
in
belief
can
sometimes
lead
to
downfall
.
