point
:
because
ai
systems
perform
work
that
previously
required
human
labor
,
they
have
the
effect
of
lowering
the
cost
of
many
goods
and
services
,
effectively
making
everyone
richer
-lrb-
p39
-rrb-
.
the
claim
that
ai
alone
can
make
everyone
richer
is
dubious
given
the
report
s
statements
concerning
the
way
that
ai
has
the
potential
to
widen
the
wealth
gap
between
middle
and
upper
classes
in
a
north
american
city
.
the
fear
that
ai
can
damage
the
middle
class
and
make
the
already
powerful
billionaires
even
more
wealthy
should
be
ever-present
in
our
discussions
concerning
the
effects
of
ai
on
our
evolving
world
.
the
challenge
of
a
shrinking
american
middle
class
is
one
politicians
and
citizens
have
struggled
with
for
several
decades
.
as
the
report
highlights
:
since
the
1990s
,
the
us
has
experienced
continued
growth
in
productivity
and
gdp
,
but
median
income
has
stagnated
and
the
employment
to
population
ratio
has
fallen
-lrb-
p38
-rrb-
.
even
though
the
american
economy
seems
to
be
improving
and
american
workers
productivity
is
growing
,
the
average
american
seems
to
be
left
in
the
dust
.
the
middle
class
are
not
reaping
the
benefits
of
their
hard
work
.
if
we
are
concerned
with
the
how
the
well-being
of
all
people
will
be
affected
by
ai
,
it
behooves
us
to
ask
how
the
middle
class
will
be
impacted
by
new
technology
outlined
in
the
report
.
thus
,
we
must
ask
the
question
:
will
ai
provide
the
american
middle
class
with
the
riches
they
deserve
or
put
the
american
dream
further
out
of
reach
of
the
average
american
?
if
we
concern
ourselves
with
those
outside
the
circles
of
ultra-rich
owners
of
ai
technology
,
the
idea
that
ai
will
make
everyone
richer
inherently
is
immediately
thrown
into
question
.
the
report
shows
us
the
dangerous
potential
future
in
which
many
find
themselves
cut
out
and
unneeded
.
this
existence
of
this
potential
future
alone
means
we
can
not
say
that
ai
will
make
everyone
richer
.
as
the
article
states
:
as
labor
becomes
a
less
important
factor
in
production
as
compared
to
owning
intellectual
capital
,
a
majority
of
citizens
may
find
the
value
of
their
labor
insufficient
to
pay
for
a
socially
acceptable
standard
of
living
-lrb-
p39
-rrb-
.
ai
actively
facilitates
a
flow
of
capital
in
the
hands
of
owners
rather
than
workers
.
this
is
very
troubling
for
those
who
aren
t
born
into
wealth
and
thus
do
not
have
access
to
the
intellectual
capital
that
is
increasingly
important
.
the
report
realizes
the
potential
negative
effects
of
ai
on
the
economy
and
offers
a
solution
that
is
largely
lacking
.
the
following
passage
is
presented
on
the
subject
:
social
and
political
decisions
are
likewise
at
play
in
ai
s
influences
on
employment
and
workplace
trends
,
such
as
the
safety
nets
needed
to
protect
people
from
structural
changes
in
the
economy
-lrb-
pg
8
-rrb-
.
the
creation
of
social
safety
nets
is
necessary
but
is
only
a
temporary
solution
to
a
larger
problem
.
as
demonstrated
,
the
problem
is
with
an
economy
that
increasingly
values
the
ownership
of
intellectual
capital
over
the
hard
work
of
american
citizens
.
thus
,
the
solution
can
t
only
be
a
safety
net
but
rather
must
entail
addressing
the
ownership
of
ai
intellectual
capital
and
preventing
a
small
group
of
people
from
controlling
the
ai
that
will
inevitably
become
even
more
central
to
our
economy
.
the
purpose
of
ai
should
be
to
improve
the
human
experience
in
every
way
possible
.
if
we
believe
this
,
we
must
ensure
that
ai
does
not
prevent
the
majority
of
the
american
population
from
reaping
the
benefits
it
produces
.
the
claim
that
cheaper
products
will
make
everyone
richer
fails
to
capture
the
necessity
we
have
to
make
sure
the
capital
generated
from
ai
ends
up
in
the
right
hands
.
if
we
recognize
that
ai
will
move
capital
away
from
workers
and
towards
owners
of
that
intellectual
property
,
we
can
not
ensure
that
ai
will
make
everyone
richer
unless
we
also
ensure
that
regular
citizens
will
also
have
claim
to
that
intellectual
property
.
