in
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
,
there
are
many
examples
of
how
ai
can
be
used
to
increase
efficiency
in
everyday
tasks
.
for
example
,
the
article
states
that
ai
may
``
help
remove
some
of
the
bias
inherent
in
human
decision-making
''
(36)
.
however
,
the
potential
tradeoff
is
that
ai
also
may
not
share
the
same
morals
or
values
as
most
humans
.
when
a
machine
becomes
the
law
and
does
not
share
the
same
set
of
values
as
humans
,
it
may
cause
issues
that
were
unintentional
.
one
example
that
quickly
comes
to
mind
is
the
topic
of
speeding
.
if
,
for
instance
,
there
is
a
stretch
of
road
where
the
speed
limit
is
set
at
70
miles
per
hour
,
the
question
must
be
asked
of
how
much
leeway
an
ai
is
willing
to
give
.
if
the
ai
is
too
strict
in
its
judgement
,
human
error
of
driving
barely
over
the
threshold
for
a
few
seconds
may
be
punished
unfairly
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
the
ai
is
too
lenient
,
speeding
could
become
a
much
bigger
issue
and
may
cause
more
traffic
accidents
.
in
this
situation
,
human
bias
and
understanding
of
mistakes
may
prove
to
be
an
advantage
.
there
are
a
multitude
of
other
examples
that
could
be
brought
up
in
which
a
robotic
,
unfeeling
ai
is
unfit
for
enforcing
the
law
.
human
morality
and
values
would
be
invaluable
in
these
cases
,
as
they
allow
for
human
error
to
be
overlooked
in
cases
that
it
is
of
no
major
concern
.
on
the
topic
of
law
enforcement
,
another
issue
arises
with
ai
.
if
ai
were
to
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
,
it
could
simplify
the
process
of
ilegal
or
immoral
activities
.
even
with
current
ai
software
,
people
are
worried
that
ai
is
being
abused
.
an
example
would
be
smartphone
facial
recognition
software
.
many
people
have
voiced
their
concerns
that
large
corporations
may
be
abusing
this
technology
to
acquire
personal
information
.
outside
of
the
corporations
,
illegal
organizations
may
also
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
people
worldwide
.
without
proper
policing
of
this
ai
technology
,
everyone
around
the
world
could
potentially
be
in
danger
of
having
their
private
information
used
against
their
will
and
knowledge
.
the
ai
has
no
morals
or
values
;
it
simply
does
what
it
is
programmed
to
do
.
it
simply
collects
information
.
the
information
and
the
technology
to
acquire
such
information
would
have
to
be
secure
,
in
order
for
the
technology
to
more
helpful
than
it
is
detrimental
.
