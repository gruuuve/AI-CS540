the
study
panel
's
report
entitled
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
for
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
offers
a
wealth
of
diverse
and
insightful
details
about
current
trends
and
potential
of
ai
.
most
of
their
points
are
robust
and
logical
.
however
,
its
claims
regarding
how
some
healthcare
implementations
of
ai
will
merely
complement
and
not
replace
certain
human
tasks
,
as
well
as
that
ai
's
success
will
be
measured
by
the
value
it
creates
for
human
lives
,
are
not
necessarily
correct
.
when
discussing
the
outlook
of
ai
in
healthcare
,
the
report
seems
uncharacteristically
short-sighted
.
it
reads
,
``
looking
ahead
,
many
tasks
that
appear
in
healthcare
will
be
amenable
to
augmentation
,
but
will
not
be
fully
automated
.
for
example
,
robots
may
be
able
to
deliver
goods
to
the
right
room
in
a
hospital
,
but
then
require
a
person
to
pick
them
up
and
place
them
in
their
final
location
''
-lrb-

.
perhaps
this
is
simply
a
poorly
chosen
example
,
but
placing
objects
in
a
final
location
seems
relatively
simple
once
a
robot
can
arrive
at
its
destination
.
if
ai
's
growth
in
hospitals
increases
as
predicted
in
the
report
,
it
seems
robots
would
likely
replace
humans
in
this
and
similar
tasks
--
especially
if
other
domains
of
ai
trend
toward
full
automation
and
establish
a
precedent
.
however
,
for
more
critical
tasks
it
seems
reasonable
that
a
human
decision
would
be
required
to
take
the
final
actions
--
much
like
present
standards
guiding
advanced
weaponry
,
which
require
a
human
to
be
the
entity
to
pull
the
trigger
after
ai
has
done
the
preliminary
work
,
though
even
those
may
be
shifting
-lrb-

.
the
other
inaccuracy
of
the
report
lies
in
its
assertion
that
``
the
measure
of
success
for
ai
applications
is
the
value
they
create
for
human
lives
''
-lrb-
``

-rrb-
.
despite
its
noble
applications
,
in
the
present
clime
dominated
by
capitalism
,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
ai
will
ultimately
be
driven
by
anything
other
than
monetary
potential
.
the
expectation
is
that
money
is
driven
by
the
interests
of
consumers
,
but
that
may
not
always
be
the
case
.
indeed
,
people
like
tristan
harris
raise
concerns
regarding
the
misaligned
interests
between
companies
who
utilize
ai
and
their
consumers
.
in
his
testimony
before
the
us
senate
in
2015
,
harris
talked
about
how
many
tech
companies
are
engaging
in
a
``
race
to
the
bottom
of
the
brainstem
''
-lrb-
``
technology
companies
and
algorithms
''
-rrb-
.
instead
of
helping
people
live
better
lives
,
some
companies
take
advantage
of
fundamental
behavioral
psychology
to
optimize
profit
at
the
expense
of
consumer
productivity
.
in
other
words
,
they
achieve
their
success
by
offering
counterfeit
value
.
harris
'
points
also
challenge
a
related
idea
stated
earlier
in
the
findings
.
the
report
reads
,
``
beneficial
ai
applications
in
schools
,
homes
,
and
hospitals
are
already
growing
...
and
technology
companies
such
as
apple
,
facebook
,
google
,
ibm
,
and
microsoft
spend
heavily
to
explore
ai
applications
they
regard
as
critical
to
their
futures
.

while
companies
may
be
advancing
the
field
of
ai
,
it
may
not
always
be
in
ways
that
are
in
consumers
'
best
interests
.
when
it
comes
to
the
extent
to
which
automation
will
intertwine
with
healthcare
,
the
study
panel
's
report
seems
unimaginative
.
when
it
comes
to
the
underlying
drivers
of
artificial
intelligence
development
,
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
na√Øve
.
but
these
constitute
only
a
few
lines
in
the
entire
report
,
and
one
of
the
expressed
purposes
of
the
study
is
to
spur
the
minds
of
future
ai
contributors
,
which
it
achieves
both
in
its
accuracies
and
inaccuracies
.
overall
,
the
findings
,
predictions
,
and
experienced
opinions
are
a
highly
informative
and
solidly
ethical
step
in
the
progression
of
artificial
intelligence
