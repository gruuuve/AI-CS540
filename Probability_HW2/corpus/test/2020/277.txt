reflection
on
ai
artificial
intelligence
is
becoming
an
important
part
of
our
life
.
it
reinforces
the
development
in
automation
and
creates
the
possibilities
for
revolutionary
leap
in
many
other
industries
.
however
,
while
ai
is
developing
significantly
,
there
are
unsolved
problems
of
ai
that
causes
challenges
from
the
society
.
to
specify
,
ai
in
healthcare
domain
is
facing
the
problem
of
personal
information
gathering
and
leak
.
according
to
the
report
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
ai
can
be
used
to
gather
healthcare
data
from
users
,
also
with
the
data
from
social
media
.
ai
would
also
define
people
as
self-defined
subpopulations
,
then
provide
recommendations
after
the
subdivision
.
the
original
intention
of
this
ai-subdivision
healthcare
project
is
to
design
customized
health
plans
for
everyone
.
however
,
it
ignores
the
major
problem
-
the
gathering
of
personal
information
,
and
other
problems
caused
by
it
afterwards
.
first
and
foremost
,
to
gather
the
personal
information
and
using
ai
to
analyze
and
subdivide
people
is
immoral
,
especially
when
the
personal
information
that
gathered
is
healthcare
information
.
to
give
an
extreme
example
,
a
heart
bypass
surgery
is
needed
when
someone
is
dying
.
however
,
from
the
subdivision
information
that
is
produced
by
ai
,
this
patient
has
a
low
rate
to
survive
after
the
surgery
.
as
a
result
,
the
hospital
decides
to
give
surgery
to
another
patient
and
ignore
the
patient
with
a
low
rate
to
survive
.
no
rescue
causes
the
death
of
this
patient
.
both
patients
are
citizens
,
they
should
be
treated
as
same
.
the
case
would
be
even
more
dangerous
if
the
hospital
is
private
and
focused
on
costs
.
from
the
social
media
information
,
ai
could
easily
distinguish
the
people
that
can
afford
the
cost
from
those
who
can
not
.
even
if
the
hospital
is
public
,
the
ai
can
still
determine
which
person
is
more
useful
to
the
society
,
for
example
,
the
one
that
pays
more
taxes
.
this
subdivision
of
people
creates
more
inequality
.
additionally
,
the
gathering
of
personal
healthcare
information
by
ai
has
a
higher
risk
on
leak
.
for
example
,
the
healthcare
information
of
a
group
of
people
has
been
exposed
.
the
data
shows
which
person
has
higher
health
risk
and
are
sold
among
companies
.
imagine
that
a
tweet
that
shows
someone
drinks
alcohol
,
and
because
of
that
tweet
,
he
or
she
is
marked
potentially
risk
for
some
illness
and
refused
by
companies
,
since
companies
have
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
maintain
their
employees
health
.
in
this
world
,
humans
need
social
media
to
express
themselves
,
and
the
data
in
social
media
usually
exposes
much
personal
information
.
using
ai
to
gather
the
data
and
subdivide
people
are
like
tagging
items
.
selling
the
information
to
international
companies
would
be
profitable
.
these
data
can
be
use
for
big
data
customized
advertisements
,
which
are
extremely
harmful
to
children
or
those
who
are
not
mentally
mature
.
to
conclude
,
it
is
harmful
for
ai
to
gather
personal
healthcare
information
and
subdivide
people
according
to
the
data
.
the
advantage
of
it
is
obvious
:
it
would
be
easier
for
people
to
acquire
healthcare
.
however
,
the
disadvantage
of
this
process
can
not
be
ignored
.
the
subdivide
of
people
creates
inequality
,
and
the
leak
of
personal
healthcare
information
are
risky
.
ai
in
healthcare
domain
should
be
considered
more
before
formal
use
.
