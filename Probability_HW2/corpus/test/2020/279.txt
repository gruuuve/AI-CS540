artificial
intelligence
,
or
more
commonly
known
as
ai
,
has
been
growing
rapidly
for
the
past
century
.
it
has
changed
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
how
we
carry
out
daily
tasks
.
from
gps
systems
to
autonomous
cars
to
robot
waiters
in
restaurants
,
ai
is
gradually
influencing
every
single
sector
.
the
report
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
written
by
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
ai
2015
study
panel
has
highlighted
the
recent
advancements
in
ai
and
how
things
will
be
like
for
the
next
15
years
.
according
to
the
report
,
the
author
states
that
contrary
to
the
more
fantastic
predictions
for
ai
in
the
popular
press
,
the
study
panel
found
no
cause
for
concern
that
ai
is
an
imminent
threat
to
humankind
,
which
means
that
we
do
not
have
to
worry
if
ai
will
take
over
humans
one
day
like
what
we
see
in
many
sci-fi
movies
.
the
article
further
elaborated
that
no
ai
with
long-term
self-sustaining
goals
are
or
will
ever
be
invented
.
however
,
this
argument
is
not
necessarily
true
.
the
entire
report
centers
its
arguments
around
how
ai
changed
lives
and
the
great
amount
of
benefits
that
comes
with
new
ai
inventions
this
decade
.
the
fact
that
ai
is
so
great
means
that
we
definitely
will
not
stop
creating
even
greater
ai
inventions
.
as
more
and
more
new
ai
technology
are
invented
,
people
also
start
to
depend
more
and
more
on
it
.
when
the
entire
population
starts
to
depend
on
ai
,
people
get
lazy
and
we
start
to
willingly
handover
our
authority
to
ai
.
for
example
,
as
autonomous
cars
soon
become
reality
,
we
will
be
willing
to
put
our
safety
in
the
hands
of
ai
.
as
ai
becomes
more
intelligent
day
by
day
,
we
handover
more
daily
tasks
to
them
,
in
turn
allowing
them
to
make
certain
life
decisions
for
us
as
well
.
it
could
backfire
badly
if
they
end
up
making
the
wrong
decisions
for
us
.
additionally
,
the
report
does
mention
that
in
medical
and
education
sectors
,
it
is
unlikely
that
ai
will
replace
everything
as
ai
are
still
not
capable
of
single-handedly
completing
certain
tasks
.
the
truth
is
there
is
no
way
we
can
possibly
know
how
intelligent
machines
can
actually
get
and
how
deep
deep
learning
can
go
.
50
years
ago
,
we
would
have
thought
self-driving
cars
and
robots
were
just
human
imagination
,
and
yet
we
are
here
today
,
living
in
a
world
full
of
unbelievable
ai
inventions
.
there
still
remains
the
possibility
that
one
day
machines
could
pick
up
the
emotions
and
common-sense
which
separates
us
humans
from
them
.
when
that
day
comes
,
there
is
no
stopping
machines
from
being
just
like
humans
yet
having
the
immense
memory
and
brainpower
of
a
machine
.
for
example
,
imagine
the
creation
of
a
robot
not
just
with
human
emotions
but
also
the
brainpower
of
something
like
the
deep
blue
computer
that
was
capable
of
beating
the
world
chess
champion
.
a
robot
like
that
could
replace
any
human
jobs
,
even
the
ones
that
require
emotions
in
the
medical
and
education
sectors
.
to
sum
it
up
,
it
is
vital
that
humans
do
not
overly
depend
on
the
greatness
of
ai
inventions
just
because
it
is
capable
of
completing
tasks
for
us
.
as
we
grow
dependent
on
it
,
we
might
lose
the
ability
to
complete
tasks
on
our
own
one
day
.
that
could
lead
to
even
more
negative
impacts
on
humanity
in
the
long
run
.
ai
may
not
take
over
us
with
guns
and
brute
force
like
in
the
matrix
,
but
it
could
very
well
cripple
our
growth
as
humanity
if
we
do
not
use
ai
inventions
wisely
.
