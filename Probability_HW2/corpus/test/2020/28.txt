i
will
be
challenging
some
of
the
points
the
authors
bring
up
section
ii
in
the
``
employment
and
workplace
''
heading
.
i
will
address
the
upper
bound
on
the
potential
of
ai
,
the
timetable
it
will
take
to
get
to
a
level
viable
to
cause
major
disruptions
in
employment
,
and
finally
will
address
how
even
the
highest
skilled
jobs
are
at
risk
.
i
do
n't
agree
with
how
the
authors
of
the
report
downplay
the
limits
of
ai
,
specifically
the
limits
to
what
problems
it
can
solve
,
i.e.
how
``
smart
''
it
can
get
,
and
the
resulting
effect
truly
advanced
ai
will
have
on
employment
.
on
a
basic
level
,
the
human
brain
is
a
computer
.
one
might
call
it
``
biological
''
intelligence
as
opposed
to
artificial
intelligence
.
it
stands
to
reason
that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
computer
that
is
at
least
as
advanced
as
a
human
brain
,
if
not
more
capable
.
the
question
at
hand
then
becomes
,
are
we
every
going
to
be
able
to
reach
that
point
?
new
technology
is
commonly
downplayed
when
it
is
in
its
early
stages
.
for
example
,
when
the
first
television
was
invented
,
some
dismissed
its
value
because
they
did
n't
believe
that
anyone
would
be
``
willing
to
look
at
a
wooden
box
all
day
''
.
similarly
,
i
believe
ai
is
in
its
early
stages
,
with
the
technology
only
now
starting
to
achieve
its
first
major
break
throughs
.
but
the
report
is
focused
on
the
state
of
ai
in
the
year
2030
,
and
thus
makes
rather
modest
estimates
of
how
far
the
technology
will
advance
by
then
.
humans
have
a
pretty
bad
track
record
when
it
comes
to
estimating
the
timetables
technology
will
evolve
at
.
for
example
,
30
years
ago
,
not
many
people
would
have
guesses
that
mobile
phones
would
proliferate
as
much
as
they
have
in
the
average
person
's
daily
life
.
on
the
other
side
of
the
spectrum
,
henry
ford
predicted
in
the
1940s
that
flying
cars
would
eventually
be
commonplace
.
fast
forward
80
years
,
and
we
have
yet
to
see
flying
cars
.
similarly
,
we
have
no
idea
how
quickly
ai
may
see
a
breakthrough
that
cause
mass
displacement
of
human
jobs
.
i
'm
not
suggesting
we
should
fear
such
a
scenario
,
but
we
ca
n't
predict
how
quickly
this
may
occur
,
nor
can
we
discredit
it
occurring
by
2030
.
i
agree
with
the
authors
'
suggesting
that
we
should
start
a
political
discourse
on
how
society
should
handle
the
upcoming
economic
shifts
that
will
result
in
ai
,
specifically
a
universal
basic
income
.
the
authors
also
state
that
ai
will
be
unable
to
completely
eliminate
some
of
the
highest
skilled
jobs
.
they
use
the
specific
example
of
a
lawyer
and
even
reference
the
paper
``
can
robots
be
lawyers
?
computers
,
lawyers
,
and
the
practice
of
law
''
which
discredits
the
idea
that
ai
will
be
able
to
replace
lawyers
.
while
they
make
fair
points
.
i
believe
that
ai
has
the
very
real
potential
to
replace
many
similar
jobs
.
for
example
,
it
is
very
plausible
that
an
ai
can
be
taught
to
do
the
design
work
of
a
civil
engineer
.
or
that
computer
vision
will
be
able
to
replace
radiologist
.
we
are
already
getting
to
the
point
where
ai
can
find
things
that
doctors
miss.
if
ai
can
do
the
job
better
and
cheaper
,
what
is
the
point
of
having
humans
work
in
these
positions
at
all
?
the
only
thing
certain
about
ai
is
the
uncertainty
surrounding
it
's
future
.
