future
of
artificial
intelligence
the
current
use
of
artificial
intelligence
only
shows
a
small
amount
of
what
is
possible
with
it
,
ai
is
just
scratching
the
surface
of
what
is
possible
to
accomplish
with
it
.
the
article
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
thoroughly
covers
what
the
future
holds
,
it
breaks
downs
into
different
sections
of
possible
improvements
that
ai
can
be
utilized
.
i
say
improvements
because
in
many
of
these
fields
ai
is
already
being
used
.
this
article
is
backed
by
many
experts
in
the
field
of
ai
but
also
in
fields
that
ai
will
impact
in
the
future
.
they
release
an
article
about
the
current
state
of
ai
,
ways
it
can
be
implemented
in
the
future
,
and
policies
regarding
the
innovations
with
ai
.
some
of
the
points
i
challenge
from
this
article
are
related
to
the
transportation
and
how
ai
might
impact
it
in
the
future
.
one
of
the
first
points
to
be
challenged
has
to
do
with
transportation
and
self-driving
cars
.
the
article
states
that
by
2020
self-driving
cars
will
be
widely
adopted
.
this
statement
is
something
i
have
an
issue
with
because
of
how
rare
it
is
to
see
a
self-driving
car
around
here
in
madison
.
not
only
see
a
self-driving
car
but
see
someone
using
the
self-driving
mode
.
i
believe
that
self-driving
cars
are
in
the
future
,
but
the
articles
estimate
of
when
that
would
be
a
widely
used
feature
was
too
early
.
self-driving
cars
still
have
a
lot
of
question
marks
about
their
safety
and
reliability
.
the
article
talks
about
how
important
building
a
trusting
relationship
with
consumers
about
these
aspects
of
self-driving
cars
and
i
think
it
will
be
something
difficult
to
achieve
.
this
is
one
of
the
points
i
personally
do
n't
believe
was
consistent
with
what
was
stated
in
the
article
.
the
second
point
i
would
challenge
from
this
article
is
on-demand
transportation
.
this
is
something
that
is
being
widely
used
now
with
companies
like
uber
and
lyft
.
the
problem
i
have
with
this
is
the
point
that
was
made
about
self-driving
cars
possibly
eliminating
the
need
for
a
car
.
inside
a
big
city
people
can
get
by
with
just
using
these
ride
sharing
options
,
but
if
you
need
to
travel
farther
distances
using
these
options
just
does
n't
make
sense
.
living
here
in
madison
and
frequently
traveling
back
to
my
hometown
to
see
friends
and
family
is
doable
with
my
own
vehicle
.
i
think
self-driving
cars
will
have
a
big
impact
on
the
way
transportation
is
thought
about
especially
in
big
cities
i
just
do
n't
see
it
being
a
substitute
for
having
your
own
vehicle
especially
if
you
do
n't
live
in
a
big
city
or
like
to
travel
often
.
