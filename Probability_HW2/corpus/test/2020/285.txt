the

``
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
''
takes
a
look
at
the
impact
of
ai
in
the
past
,
present
and
future
.
while
the
report
offers
many
good
points
,
there
are
some
which
i
simply
can
not
agree
with
.
the
report
states
that
ai
is
not
a
threat
to
society
as
we
know
it
because
it
does
not
replace
jobs
,
but
rather
it
replaces
tasks
within
jobs
,
making
existing
jobs
more
efficient
.
this
brings
my
statement
of
disagreement
:
the
notion
that
ai
is
not
an
immediate
threat
to
society
as
we
know
it
because
most
jobs
are
safe
could
not
be
further
from
the
truth
;
while
ai
can
assist
with
high
skill
jobs
,
it
will
eliminate
low
skill
jobs
and
derail
society
.
the
report
claims
that
ai
will
assist
with
``
tasks
''
in
current
jobs
rather
than
replace
existing
jobs
.
on
page
26
,
the
report
gives
the
example
of
physicians
.
it
states
physicians
'
jobs
are
safe
because
ai
will
not
be
able
to
replace
the
work
physicians
do
;
rather
,
ai
will
assist
with
things
like
identifying
tumors
,
allowing
the
physician
to
do
their
job
better
while
verifying
the
work
of
the
ai
.
i
agree
with
the
author
's
point
in
regards
to
this
specific
example
--
i
agree
that
,
for
the
near
future
,
the
jobs
of
physicians
are
safe
,
and
that
ai
will
enable
people
in
those
roles
to
perform
at
a
higher
level
than
ever
before
.
however
,
the
connections
to
society
as
a
whole
that
the
report
makes
from
this
example
are
invalid
.
society
is
still
at
a
massive
risk
because
while
ai
can
only
help
with
some
tasks
in
high
skill
jobs
,
it
can
and
will
replace
low
skill
jobs
.
low
skill
jobs
are
at
risk
for
the
exact
reason
the
author
claims
that
ai
is
not
a
problem
:
ai
is
great
at
replacing
tasks
.
the
problem
is
,
most
low
skill
jobs
are
just
tasks
.
for
example
,
a
cash
register
worker
's
entire
job
is
to
perform
the
task
of
recording
orders
and
taking
money
.
ai
can
already
do
this
task
better
than
a
human
can
,
and
already
has
started
to
steal
these
jobs
from
workers
.
because
low
skill
jobs
are
essentially
just
tasks
,
ai
will
take
these
jobs
and
leave
millions
without
work
and
a
safety
net
.
the
damage
ai
will
create
by
taking
low
skill
jobs
is
massive
.
according
to
kauffman
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
,
currently
30
%
+
of
people
have
jobs
that
are
deemed
low
skill
and
that
number
is
expected
to
rise
in
the
near
future
.
as
companies
begin
to
see
that
the
cost
of
implementing
ai
systems
to
replace
their
low
skill
workers
is
cheaper
and
more
effective
than
paying
people
to
do
those
same
tasks
,
there
will
be
massive
layoffs
and
millions
without
work
.
without
the
proper
legislative
overhauls
,
millions
will
fall
into
poverty
within
the
next
few
years
.
while
the
report
talks
of
legislative
overhaul
,
it
does
not
emphasize
an
adequate
time
frame
for
implementation
.
the
report
states
that
ai
will
replace
tasks
,
not
jobs
and
therefore
our
society
as
we
know
it
is
safe
from
disaster
in
the
immediate
future
.
this
could
not
be
further
from
the
truth
and
this
line
of
thinking
is
leading
us
to
disaster
.
the
report
's
vast
understatement
of
the
immidiate
issues
with
ai
is
a
mistake
with
the
potential
to
cause
unimaginable
harm
.
ai
can
and
will
replace
the
low
skill
jobs
that
operate
within
the
scope
of
a
singular
task
.
we
must
get
ahead
of
this
problem
as
soon
as
possible
to
ensure
a
prosperous
future
for
our
world
.
