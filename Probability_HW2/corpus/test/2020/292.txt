reflection
transportation
is
one
of
the
most
popular
uses
of
ai
mostly
stemming
from
the
excitement
of
self-driving
cars
.
while
it
is
not
limited
to
just
that
as
ride
sharing
and
smart
cities
also
play
an
important
role
.
predictions
about
how
self-driving
vehicles
will
play
apart
in
society
seem
to
not
take
into
account
the
difficulty
of
switching
over
to
these
types
of
cars
.
in
the
standford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
it
was
mentioned
that
a
recent
report
predicts
self-driving
cars
to
be
widely
adopted
by
2020
.
obviously
,
it
is
now
2020
and
while
semi-autonomous
vehicles
are
present
on
the
road
it
is
not
close
to
being
widely
adopted
.
this
was
not
caused
because
the
self-driving
not
preforming
well
enough
or
the
high
cost
of
these
vehicles
.
rather
the
main
issue
is
how
long
it
takes
for
people
to
upgrade
to
new
cars
.
the
average
time
a
person
keeps
a
car
is
around
six
years
,
self-driving
cars
started
to
become
available
to
the
public
around
the
time
of
the
report
(2016)
.
so
,
even
if
in
2016
all
cars
on
the
market
were
replaced
by
self-driving
cars
it
would
more
than
likely
take
till
2020\/21
for
it
to
be
widely
adopted
.
on
top
of
being
able
to
predict
that
these
new
self-driving
cars
would
be
expensive
with
more
to
be
desired
with
the
autonomous
driving
.
the
competition
with
current
cars
on
the
market
and
the
expected
lifetimes
of
the
vehicles
point
toward
it
being
a
while
before
self-driving
cars
are
going
to
be
widely
adopted
.
on
the
topic
of
transportation
,
it
was
also
said
in
the
stanford
reading
that
self-driving
cars
and
peer-to-peer
transportation
services
may
eliminate
the
need
to
own
a
vehicle
.
this
does
not
seem
feasible
,
even
when
vehicles
will
be
able
to
drive
on
their
own
with
super-human
skills
,
the
need
to
own
a
vehicle
or
property
will
always
be
present
.
this
can
be
seen
with
current
ride
share
programs
for
scooters
and
e-bikes
.
while
they
are
a
convenient
and
a
cheap
way
to
commute
large
cities
there
will
always
be
people
that
disagree
with
them
.
it
can
be
seen
on
social
media
of
people
destroying
the
scooters
by
stealing
,
burning
,
and
tossing
these
vehicles
as
they
do
not
agree
with
them
.
this
stems
from
the
issue
of
no
one
owning
the
vehicles
as
they
are
just
a
rideshare
vehicle
.
there
will
always
be
people
that
disagree
with
autonomous
driving
no
matter
how
well
it
is
branded
and
shown
to
the
public
.
there
will
always
be
accidents
caused
by
the
vehicles
that
could
maybe
have
been
prevented
if
there
was
a
human
at
the
wheel
.
causing
at
least
a
part
of
society
not
to
agree
with
the
vehicles
.
this
could
lead
to
vandalization
of
the
them
as
no
one
really
owns
them
.
where
if
the
cars
were
personal
property
there
would
be
more
stopping
someone
from
vandalizing
the
vehicle
because
of
your
own
protection
of
the
vehicle
or
respect
for
personal
property
.
for
the
same
reason
that
someone
against
e-scooters
would
more
than
likely
vandalize
the
one
owned
by
a
company
rather
than
an
individual
.
transportation
will
have
the
largest
impact
on
society
in
the
near
future
compared
to
other
domains
of
ai
.
but
self-driving
cars
seem
to
be
predicted
to
play
a
larger
role
in
our
lives
sooner
than
we
should
expect
.
these
delays
are
caused
by
the
difficulty
of
replacing
current
cars
and
the
need
for
private
ownership
.
