artificial
intelligence
has
plenty
of
untapped
potential
as
described
in
this
report
.
claiming
to
detail
or
outline
the
ai
will
have
on
society
over
next
fifteen
years
,
i
think
the
author
pushes
away
the
possible
outcomes
in
the
decades
after
.
while
ai
has
a
seemingly
unlimited
use
to
improve
human
lives
,
there
is
matched
volume
in
which
ai
can
be
used
with
malintent
.
the
author
does
a
great
job
of
explaining
the
different
reaches
that
ai
has
on
society
as
well
as
its
potential
positive
and
negative
impacts
.
however
,
the
author
only
touches
briefly
on
malicious
use
.
the
immediate
benefits
that
ai
would
have
on
our
lives
provides
a
good
case
to
push
for
legal
approval
,
thus
faster
innovation
within
the
field
.
so
why
not
just
dive
right
in
?
bad
practice
is
one
of
the
reasons
preventing
this
and
should
be
considered
to
become
more
dangerous
as
the
technology
improves
,
providing
more
opportunity
for
malicious
ai
to
find
workarounds
to
security
,
and
while
physical
harm
is
n't
likely
with
the
current
or
near
future
versions
of
ai
,
it
still
has
the
ability
to
adversely
affect
human
lives
considering
the
widespread
iot
.
we
have
to
consider
the
possibility
that
an
ai
capable
of
solving
crimes
and
providing
legal
representation
,
can
also
be
used
conversely
to
strategize
against
our
current
and
future
forms
of
security
.
so
while
it
is
great
that
the
author
mentions
that
,
``
ai
may
be
thought
of
as
a
radically
different
mechanism
of
wealth
creation
in
which
everyone
should
be
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
world
's
ai-produced
treasure
''
,
the
keyword
is
everyone
.
preventative
measures
would
have
to
be
taken
to
keep
ai
technologies
from
falling
into
the
wrong
hands
,
and
with
that
a
fair
amount
of
exclusion
would
take
place
.
this
violates
the
idea
of
non-discrimination
when
providing
access
to
ai
related
benefits
.
the
author
explains
the
possibility
of
increasing
existing
inequalities
,
and
with
an
ai
that
is
regulated
to
prevent
bad
practices
,
this
inequality
gap
is
sure
to
grow
.
fast
forward
many
decades
in
the
future
beyond
the
scope
of
the
report
and
there
will
be
many
societal
problems
created
by
ai
,
although
the
initial
and
current
thinking
described
by
the
author
denies
the
likelihood
of
this
occurrence
.
and
i
agree
,
yes
there
will
be
many
great
things
to
come
from
ai
in
the
next
couple
of
decades
with
the
benefits
outweighing
the
risks
given
proper
supervision
.
however
,
considering
that
human
trust
of
ai
as
well
as
the
urgency
to
advance
the
technology
further
into
our
lives
in
order
to
reap
the
benefits
and
create
a
better
world
for
all
is
the
eventual
goal
of
ai
moving
forward
,
there
is
a
highly
proportional
increase
in
the
dangers
that
we
could
face
once
ai
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
lives
and
we
're
unable
to
stop
it
as
it
grows
in
magnitude
.
similar
to
how
vaccines
,
good
health
practices
,
and
government
intervention
can
slow
the
spread
and
even
eliminate
viruses
,
the
same
can
be
done
to
fight
against
improper
usage
of
ai
,
which
is
ideally
what
happens
in
the
coming
years
.
the
real
danger
is
when
malicious
use
outpaces
the
securities
that
we
develop
,
and
with
an
infinitely
faster
infection
rate
than
human
diseases
,
the
damage
will
have
already
been
done
.
and
with
that
,
the
cost
benefits
of
ai
could
be
negated
in
just
one
misstep
.
