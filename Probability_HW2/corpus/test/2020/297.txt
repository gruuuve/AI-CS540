artificial

-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
,
this
word
has
recently
been
around
daily
life
for
at
least
a
decade
.
many
people
may
not
notice
their
appearances
and
how
close
they
are
to
them
.
for
example
,
you
may
notice
that
there
are
food
delivery
robots
running
around
the
campus
.
similar
to
a
person
,
you
can
not
just
follow
the
path
without
looking
at
the
road
while
walking
,
these
robots
must
have
some
algorithm
that
allows
them
to
travel
efficiently
.
a
closer
example
is
the
vacuum
cleaner
.
i
personally
have
one
of
which
will
go
around
your
house
and
clean
wherever
it
goes
without
having
to
know
the
map
.
nowadays
,
there
is
one
important
thing
that
no
one
can
miss
out
:
social
networking
.
according
to
the
article
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
by
stanford
university
,
ai
,
surprisingly
,
involved
in
it
too
.
the
article
notes
that
there
is
a
collaborative
filtering
algorithm
that
will
recommend
movies
or
songs
to
the
user
using
their
browsing
history

.
i
personally
found
that
this
is
very
true
in
my
experiences
.
every
time
that
i
am
searching
for
any
products
,
they
will
soon
appear
in
my
social
networking
site
's
advertisement
.
in
my
opinion
,
mere
exposure
effects
from
these
advertisements
are
very
powerful
and
efficient
in
a
lot
of
time
;
and
it
is
too
powerful
in
some
aspects
.
these
ai
algorithms
are
applied
to
us
in
a
way
that
we
have
less
,
if
not
at
all
,
idea
about
it
;
the
sites
never
ask
us
for
permission
to
analyze
our
browsing
history
.
there
should
be
more
concerns
about
making
this
more
transparent
.
the
networking
sites
should
provide
us
more
detailed
information
about
how
are
they
going
to
use
our
history
of
searching
things
since
if
they
can
get
to
that
information
it
also
means
that
they
can
use
it
for
another
intention
that
we
do
n't
know
too
.
placing
ai
in
social
networking
has
an
advantage
,
but
we
should
be
that
the
closer
it
is
to
us
it
could
violate
our
privacy
.
ai
in
social
networking
is
one
of
those
concerns
.
the
article
also
mentions
about
artificial
intelligence
will
also
encourage
more
interaction
between
human
and
their
device
.
a
visualizable
example
for
me
is
``
face
filter
''
in
chatting
applications
such
as
snapchat
or
instagram
.
this
feature
allows
the
users
to
place
their
faces
inside
a
funny
picture
or
even
play
a
game
on
it
.
this
is
an
example
uses
of
computer
vision
which
will
recognize
your
face
in
order
to
use
it
in
the
feature
.
however
,
the
article
also
notes
that
ai
corporation
in
social
media
attracts
more
users
to
it
and
eventually
will
reduce
interaction
between
human
and
human
.
