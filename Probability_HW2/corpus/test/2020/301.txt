reflection
on
ai
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
didn
t
truly
made
sense
to
me
until
i
came
to
college
and
saw
real
world
discussions
and
applications
.
just
as
many
others
,
who
had
-lrb-
and
continue
to
have
-rrb-
limited
knowledge
in
this
field
,
most
of
what
i
came
to
learn
to
be
the
quintessential
model
of
ai
originates
from
science
fiction
movies
like
the
matrix
and
reports
we
get
from
the
media
.
many
of
the
topics
i
came
to
associate
with
ai
include
,
but
not
restricted
to
,
massive
job
losses
that
tend
to
leave
masses
unemployed
and
unable
to
maintain
a
minimum
lifestyle
,
rouge
machines
who
roam
the
streets
with
nefarious
intentions
,
trying
to
dominate
,
if
not
obliterate
the
human
race
,
and
cybercriminal
who
use
their
technology
prowess
to
stalk
,
bully
,
and
collect
information
on
their
victims
.
now
,
as
a
computer
science
student
,
i
believe
that
ai
and
its
tributaries
offer
nothing
,
but
exceptional
community
growth
and
human
development
at
a
rate
never-before
.
this
is
what
the
report
of
the
2015
study
panel
on
ai
and
life
in
2030
describes
as
contrary
to
the
more
fantastic
predictions
for
ai
in
the
popular
press
,
the
study
panel
found
no
cause
for
concern
that
ai
is
an
imminent
threat
to
humankind
.
instead
,
increasingly
useful
applications
of
ai
,
with
potentially
profound
positive
impacts
on
our
society
and
economy
are
likely
to
emerge
between
now
and
2030
.
in
this
context
,
i
absolutely
agree
with
the
report
that
humans
shouldn
t
be
scared
about
the
advancement
of
ai
but
should
strive
for
its
development
.
that
said
,
there
are
other
parts
of
the
report
that
i
seek
to
challenge
;
specifically
,
the
report
seeks
to
largely
overshadow
the
imminent
negative
repercussions
of
ai
that
will
cause
instabilities
and
uncertainties
in
real
life
setting
all
with
the
hopes
that
the
benefits
in
the
long
run
will
outstretch
the
bad
in
the
short
run
.
in
as
much
as
i
believe
that
societies
should
be
open
to
the
idea
of
ai
s
advancement
and
usage
,
i
believe
there
should
be
considerations
for
the
effects
it
will
have
on
the
life
of
the
everyday
worker
,
who
doesn
t
have
the
capacity
to
retrain
or
reequip
themselves
to
benefit
from
ai
.
i
believe
ai
can
easily
disrupt
the
job
market
,
facilitate
cybercrimes
,
invade
on
people
s
privacy
,
disregard
ethical
and
cultural
institutions
,
widen
the
gap
in
society
,
reinforce
stereotypes
and
risk
offending
minorities
and
marginalized
persons
,
and
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
person
,
disrupt
the
building
blocks
of
many
societies
such
as
democracy
.
a
statement
like
this
seems
to
encourage
the
removal
of
checks
and
balances
to
ai
:
if
society
approaches
these
technologies
primarily
with
fear
and
suspicion
,
missteps
that
slow
ai
s
development
or
drive
it
underground
will
result
,
impeding
important
work
on
ensuring
the
safety
and
reliability
of
ai
technologies
.
in
addition
to
my
challenge
to
the
report
,
none
of
the
hot
issues
that
were
discussed
in
the
report
sought
to
try
to
be
in
place
to
stop
possible
misuses
that
i
mentioned
above
.
in
retrospect
,
i
believe
that
we
are
yet
to
truly
see
the
many
effects
that
ai
will
have
on
humanity
.
yes
,
there
is
a
tiny
chance
that
ai
will
be
terrorizing
humanity
soon
,
however
the
real
danger
is
what
people
with
ai
capabilities
will
seek
to
do
with
such
abilities
.
as
such
,
i
challenge
and
propose
that
more
regulations
should
be
put
in
place
to
reduce
the
immediate
effects
of
ai
on
people
while
simultaneously
not
stifling
innovation
-lrb-
as
that
-rrb-
would
be
counterproductive
