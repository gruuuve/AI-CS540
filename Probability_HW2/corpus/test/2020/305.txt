the
first
point
i
would
like
to
challenge
the
essay
on
is
about
healthcare
.
certainly
,
it
is
an
excellent
idea
to
use
ai
in
prediction
and
diagnosis
because
ai
can
give
completely
objective
analysis
free
of
any
subjective
opinions
.
however
,
this
article
emphasizes
too
much
on
the
role
of
ai
in
the
medical
realm
.
the
author
believes
that
eventually
the
medical
system
will
be
managed
by
ai
and
the
doctors
and
nurses
only
serve
to
pilot
the
system
.
i
believe
that
the
medical
professionals
still
play
the
most
significant
role
even
with
the
presence
of
ai
.
being
completely
objective
is
a
good
feature
of
ai
,
but
it
can
also
be
its
shortage
.
it
is
extremely
important
to
understand
the
emotions
and
the
mindset
of
patients
seeking
help
.
patients
'
emotion
can
and
will
greatly
affect
the
effectiveness
of
medical
treatment
.
when
patients
come
to
the
hospital
,
they
would
like
to
speak
to
a
doctor
face
to
face
who
will
listen
to
them
and
give
them
feedback
not
only
in
words
but
also
through
actions
and
facial
expressions
.
imagine
going
to
a
hospital
and
only
see
an
emotionless
ai
which
may
not
even
have
a
human
appearance
.
furthermore
,
i
believe
that
if
ai
gets
too
popular
in
the
medical
field
,
the
medical
professionals
may
begin
to
become
sub-standard
because
if
ai
can
do
everything
for
them
,
they
would
not
need
the
amount
of
knowledge
and
experience
as
before
.
i
believe
that
ai
can
be
a
great
helper
in
healthcare
,
but
it
will
never
take
over
the
role
of
doctors
and
nurses
.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
challenge
the
essay
on
is
about
public
safety
.
i
have
read
numerous
articles
on
this
matter
and
they
all
sound
quite
assuring
.
it
is
a
great
idea
to
use
ai
as
a
first
step
filter
for
criminal
acts
.
it
saves
a
large
amount
of
human
resources
because
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
entire
crew
stare
at
the
cameras
all
day
anymore
.
i
do
not
hold
any
opinions
against
using
ai
to
catch
white
collar
crime
because
an
ai
will
be
able
to
excellently
accomplish
this
goal
.
however
,
i
do
have
some
concerns
on
deploying
a
huge
amount
of
cameras
for
surveillance
.
privacy
is
a
significant
matter
in
the
united
states
.
since
it
is
very
easy
to
find
crime
scenes
with
the
help
of
ai
,
the
same
amount
of
staff
members
will
be
able
to
maintain
hundreds
of
times
more
cameras
,
which
means
more
cameras
must
be
deployed
in
order
to
keep
these
people
employed
.
having
more
cameras
means
more
public
resources
and
less
privacy
for
civilians
.
there
must
be
a
balance
between
ai
and
privacy
.
