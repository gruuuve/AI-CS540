reflection
``
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
-
is
a
detailed
review
of
the
developments
in
the
field
of
ai
over
the
years
.
the
report
defines
ai
as
an
``
activity
devoted
to
making
machines
intelligent
''
.
it
further
goes
on
to
define
a
clear
difference
between
human
brain
and
artificial
intelligence
-
``
the
difference
between
an
arithmetic
calculator
and
a
human
brain
is
not
one
of
kind
,
but
of
scale
,
speed
,
degree
of
autonomy
,
and
generality
.
''
it
then
discusses
the
advances
and
scope
of
ai
in
the
fields
of
transportation
,
home\/service
robots
,
healthcare
and
more
.
the
primary
goal
of
this
paper
is
to
challenge
the
points
made
by
the
author
on
how
ai-produced
treasures
influence
public
safety
and
security
.
according
to
the
author
,
by
2030
,
most
of
the
north
american
cities
will
heavily
rely
on
ai
to
provide
protection
against
white-collar
crimes
and
help
surveillance
,
solving
crimes
and
social
network
analysis
.
the
author
discusses
various
ways
in
which
ai
tools
prove
to
be
useful
in
detecting
cyber
crimes
,
carrying
out
widespread
surveillance
and
maintain
security
at
ports
,
airports
and
various
industrial
facilitates
.
however
,
one
must
understand
that
ai
works
on
what
it
learns
from
surroundings
or
what
data
is
provided
to
it
.
its
application
in
national
,
domestic
and
cyber
security
opens
new
gates
for
adversaries
to
break
into
records
by
systematically
feeding
wrong
information
to
the
ai
systems
and
thus
creating
automated
agents
.
an
example
of
such
violation
is
-
in
the
recent
2016
u.s
election
cycle
,
the
american
intelligence
agencies
reported
foreign
interference
via
foreign
cyberattacks
.
these
attacks
were
an
attempt
to
affect
voters
'
opinions
as
they
publicly
released
hacked
private
data
.
the
author
recognizes
the
threat
of
ai
to
security
by
sharing
an
incident
from
the
movie
``
minority
report
''
where
predictive
policing
tools
raise
the
specter
of
innocent
people
being
unjustifiably
targeted
.
however
,
feels
that
``
well-deployed
ai
prediction
tools
''
can
reduce
human
bias
.
secondly
,
ai
pose
great
risk
to
domestic
security
as
government
deploys
artificial
agents
for
surveillance
of
civilians
.
government
surveillance
indicates
government
's
intent
to
act
which
might
not
be
morally
right
all
the
time
and
may
violate
citizen
's
rights
.
thus
a
major
concern
regarding
growing
use
of
ai
for
security
purposes
is
that
it
conflicts
with
the
fundamental
citizens
'
rights
.
``
the
risks
of
artificial
intelligence
to
security
and
the
future

a.
osoba
presents
an
example
where
the
use
of
traffic
cameras
is
a
potential
6th
amendment
rights
violation
as
it
is
classified
as
evidence
produced
by
nonhuman
automated
agents
.
the
report
records
various
advancements
made
by
ai
in
the
human
world
and
mentions
its
affects
on
people
's
lives
in
present
and
future
.
it
is
evident
that
in
the
coming
years
this
technology
would
change
practices
of
politics
,
urbanization
,
economics
and
lifestyle
.
thus
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
ai
's
threats
along
with
supporting
innovation
.
the
report
quotes
-
``
like
other
technologies
,
ai
has
the
potential
to
be
used
for
good
or
nefarious
purposes
.
a
vigorous
and
informed
debate
about
how
to
best
steer
ai
in
ways
that
enrich
our
lives
and
our
society
is
an
urgent
and
vital
need
''
-
this
emphasizes
on
the
requirement
of
more
and
tougher
regulations
on
the
use
and
development
of
ai
.
applications
of
ai
can
be
beneficial
for
human
race
only
if
ethical
,
privacy
and
security
concerns
are
kept
in
check
.
