reflection
in
the
next
10
years
i
agree
that
the
world
will
be
a
much
different
place
with
regard
to
ai
.
the
point
that
i
disagree
most
with
throughout
the
article
was
to
what
extent
the
social
impact
of
ai
will
be
.
i
think
this
is
easiest
to
see
with
regard
to
ai
's
impact
on
the
workplace
.
it
has
been
long
known
that
uber
is
working
to
develop
their
own
self
driving
car
.
when
this
happens
the
job
of
taxi
driver
will
be
extinct
in
just
a
few
weeks
in
america
.
this
on
its
own
is
a
significant
change
that
i
do
n't
believe
we
are
ready
for
.
when
you
compare
this
job
loss
to
the
projected
ability
of
ai
it
becomes
almost
insignificant
.
projects
like
x.
ai
already
exist
that
do
scheduling
for
executives
.
in
my
own
experience
you
no
longer
see
a
receptionist
when
you
walk
into
a
manufacturing
plant
.
this
is
because
automated
systems
are
taking
the
place
of
those
receptionists
.
as
ai
advances
more
and
more
of
these
jobs
will
disappear
and
i
do
n't
think
it
's
very
likely
that
many
jobs
are
going
to
spring
up
in
the
wake
of
ai
.
it
is
a
common
trope
to
say
that
when
a
technology
comes
out
that
makes
a
job
obsolete
it
will
be
replaced
by
another
job
focused
on
fixing
or
administering
that
technology
.
this
is
n't
true
to
the
extent
people
would
like
to
believe
.
if
you
have
an
assembly
line
and
20
people
work
on
it
,
but
then
you
replace
that
line
with
automation
then
you
only
need
1
or
2
people
to
manage
that
line
.
you
may
think
that
you
need
a
technician
then
to
fix
the
machines
,
but
you
only
need
one
of
those
to
service
many
machines
.
when
all
is
said
and
done
all
of
the
people
who
used
to
work
on
that
assembly
line
do
n't
have
new
jobs
,
or
the
ability
to
get
the
education
needed
to
get
a
new
job
.
i
'm
not
sure
if
we
will
see
dramatic
effects
of
this
in
the
next
10
years
,
but
it
is
certainly
coming
.
the
other
problem
with
ai
in
the
workplace
has
to
do
with
hiring
.
the
programs
stella
and
koru
have
come
out
in
the
past
couple
of
years
with
the
purpose
to
find
the
best
person
for
a
specific
job
.
the
problem
with
these
programs
is
that
they
currently
have
bias
based
on
the
data
sets
they
were
given
to
learn
how
to
best
place
people
.
the
article
we
read
addressed
this
.
they
said
that
although
this
may
be
the
case
right
now
,
ai
has
the
potential
to
eliminate
bias
in
the
future
.
i
agree
that
this
is
possible
,
but
i
hesitate
to
say
we
will
get
there
in
the
next
10
years
.
i
think
for
the
foreseeable
future
the
descrimination
in
these
hiring
programs
will
become
more
of
a
problem
due
to
the
lack
of
transparency
of
their
algorithms
.
the
problem
is
that
if
they
make
their
algorithms
more
transparent
then
they
could
have
the
technology
stolen
from
them
,
but
also
people
will
find
ways
to
write
their
applications
so
as
to
improve
their
chances
at
a
job
.
this
will
make
writing
the
programs
to
account
for
this
all
the
harder
.
the
descrimination
the
programs
have
right
now
can
create
social
problems
,
which
will
damage
the
reputation
of
these
systems
and
make
it
harder
to
market
them
in
the
future
.
