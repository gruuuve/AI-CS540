the
attitude
toward
artificial
intelligent
s
effect
on
employment
and
workplace
in
the
paper
is
overly
optimistic
.
according
to
stanford
university
(2016)
,
ai
will
likely
replace
tasks
rather
than
jobs
in
the
near
term
,
and
will
also
create
other
kinds
of
new
jobs
,
although
those
new
jobs
that
will
emerge
are
harder
to
imagine
in
advance
than
the
existing
jobs
that
will
likely
be
lost
.
such
an
opinion
could
be
easily
challenged
as
the
job
market
nowadays
is
based
on
simple
repetitive
labor
on
a
certain
level
.
human
resources
employees
identified
that
data
entry
and
retail
or
checkout
jobs
as
the
most
likely
to
be
replaced
by
ai
,
and
employees
who
work
in
customer
service
,
which
tend
toward
pessimism
,
the
study
said
,
chose
the
jobs
of
retail\/checkout
clerk
and
telemarketer
as
the
most
likely
to
suffer
from
ai

that
means
many
jobs
that
fit
mediocre
workers
or
people
with
not
very
high
education
backgrounds
would
be
gone
.
indeed
,
there
would
be
new
positions
appear
in
the
job
market
,
and
some
of
them
have
shown
up
already
.
president
of
the
mapi
foundation
stephen
gold
said
that
manufacturing
is
already
facing
a
shortage
of
jobs
,
and
advanced
technologies
have
created
more
technical
and
labor
challenges
to
find
and
retain
talent
with
the
necessary
digital
skills
,

those
new
jobs
were
highly
education
demanded
positions
,
so
they
could
not
solve
the
unemployed
problems
caused
by
ai
replacements
.
moreover
,
the
assertion
in
the
paper
about
the
ai
application
in
the
clinical
setting
lack
of
thoughtful
considerations
.
as
it
said
in
the
paper
,
ai
advances
would
change
the
cognitive
tasks
assigned
to
human
clinicians
once
supported
by
sufficient
data
like
electronic
health
records

ehrs

and
well-targeted
systems

years

.
in
fact
,
even
if
ai
is
supported
by
accumulated
ehrs
data
,
the
ai
analysis
results
would
not
be
accurate
enough
for
the
clinical
settings
.
since
all
input
data
are
generated
within
a
non-stationary
environment
with
shifting
patient
populations
,
where
clinical
and
operational
practices
evolve
over
time
when
introducing
a
new
predictive
algorithm
the
model
may
cause
changes
in
practice
and
lead
to
a
new
distribution
compared
to
that
used
to
train
the
algorithm

also
,
sufficient
data
and
well-targeted
systems
could
be
hindered
by
discriminatory
bias
.
according
to
kelly
,
karthikesalingam
,
and
suleyman
(2019)
,
unintended
or
unknown
accuracies
in
minority
subgroups
and
the
potential
for
amplifying
biases
present
in
the
historical
data
might
cause
varied
accuracy
by
ethnicity
.
even
if
ai
is
capable
of
participating
in
the
clinical
setting
,
the
adoption
of
ai
applications
in
the
clinical
setting
is
their
black-box
nature
and
the
resulting
trust
issues
could
become
great
issues
.
the

black

nature
could
cause

as

by

physicians
reluctance
to

due
to

risk

and
difficulty
in
identifying

cause
of
