fully
autonomous
transportation
will
not
happen
anytime
soon
nor
self-driving
cars
will
drive
better
than
humans
.
currently
,
it
is
not
possible
to
own
a
fully
self-driving
car
and
use
it
on
public
roads
in
the
united
states
.
self-driving
cars
are
not
designed
to
handle
uncertain
and
ambiguous
situations
,
it
would
still
require
human
intervention
.
this
is
what
most
self-driving
cars
are
like
today
,
a
tesla
can
be
considered
a
level
3
car
.
it
could
pretty
much
drive
on
its
own
but
still
require
certain
conditions
such
as
active
driver
supervision
,
clear
lane
markings
and
good
weather
.
in
its
current
state
,
a
self-driving
car
can
not
be
compared
to
a
human
driver
.
the
data
available
for
self-driving
cars
is
very
miniscule
compared
to
a
traditional
car
.
the
miles
driven
by
self-driving
cars
are
still
too
little
for
researchers
to
make
a
fair
comparison
.
furthermore
,
most
of
the
miles
that
were
driven
by
self-driving
cars
occurred
on
highways
.
this
meant
that
it
could
easily
stayed
in
its
own
lane
and
drive
through
relatively
flat
roads
.
there
are
still
many
challenges
that
a
self-driving
car
faces
which
makes
it
a
worse
driver
than
a
human
.
cameras
,
sensors
and
computers
are
all
components
that
can
fail
at
anytime
without
any
warning
.
these
are
all
vital
towards
autonomous
driving
,
without
them
the
car
would
not
know
how
to
drive
anymore
.
roads
are
another
huge
factor
for
self-driving
cars
,
they
require
clear
lane
markings
and
signs
.
most
public
roads
in
the
united
states
are
not
autonomous
vehicle
friendly
and
requires
a
lot
of
work
to
support
these
vehicles
.
traditional
cars
driven
by
humans
is
already
considered
relatively
safe
,
how
much
safer
would
a
self-driving
car
have
to
be
for
it
to
be
considered
safe
?
at
what
point
would
it
be
comfortable
for
someone
to
fully
trust
a
vehicle
that
they
have
no
control
over
?
these
are
questions
that
should
be
asked
before
fully
implementing
autonomous
vehicles
.
city-dwellers
would
still
own
the
same
number
of
cars
and
continue
living
in
the
city
.
not
everyone
would
be
able
to
afford
a
self-driving
car
as
the
costs
would
be
high
due
to
the
research
and
development
that
went
into
it
.
having
self-driving
cars
does
not
immediately
solve
traffic
problems
.
a
self-driving
car
will
find
it
difficult
navigating
especially
in
big
cities
where
there
are
many
traffic
lights
and
pedestrian
crossings
.
travel
time
with
self-driving
cars
would
still
be
the
same
just
that
people
would
be
able
to
do
work
in
their
cars
while
they
travel
.
in
conclusion
,
fully
autonomous
vehicle
is
still
in
its
very
early
stages
and
has
a
long
way
to
go
.
there
are
still
many
obstacles
to
overcome
but
with
todays
technology
it
would
not
be
long
before
a
solution
is
formed
.
safety
will
still
be
the
biggest
concern
regarding
self-driving
cars
and
it
should
be
addressed
properly
.
in
the
near
future
where
all
these
issues
were
to
be
resolved
,
self-driving
cars
would
definitely
be
used
for
many
different
purposes
.
it
is
not
only
limited
to
cars
,
but
also
drones
and
trucks
.
