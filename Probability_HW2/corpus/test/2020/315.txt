``
future
belongs
to
technology
''
,
this
is
a
phrase
i
've
heard
since
i
was
young
.
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
has
been
everywhere
of
our
lives
and
improves
the
efficiency
of
many
places
such
as
medical
,
education
and
entertainment
.
we
can
not
deny
the
benefits
ai
brings
to
us
,
but
meanwhile
,
we
should
take
a
critical
sight
to
carefully
consider
the
information
provided
in
this
report
.
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
points
that
writers
did
not
analyze
thoroughly
.
i
will
discuss
them
in
the
following
.
first
of
all
,
the
authors
have
confidence
on
the
premise
of
ai
in
teaching
process
,
claiming
that
paralleling
with
formal
education
,
ai
education
such
as
mooc
,
will
also
be
popular
in
the
future
.
however
,
although
it
is
true
that
online
education
is
more
personalized
and
affordable
than
formal
education
,
pedagogies
should
consider
the
communication
skills
,
critical
thinking
and
group
cooperation
that
can
only
formed
in
traditional
``
classroom
education
''
.
despite
not
related
to
education
perception
,
these
skills
are
crucial
for
students
and
important
factors
in
employing
procedure
.
but
online
education
precludes
the
form
of
study
group
and
the
communication
and
brainstorm
process
within
peers
in
some
extends
.
take
cs
courses
in
mooc
as
an
example
,
people
usually
use
their
spare
time
learning
algorithms
at
home
sitting
in
front
of
computer
.
can
mooc
ensure
the
active
participation
of
them
?
can
professor
in
videos
interact
with
them
?
can
classmates
cooperate
to
come
up
with
the
best
solution
of
a
problem
?
when
these
questions
come
,
we
have
to
re-think
the
trade-off
of
the
``
smart
education
''
.
in
addition
,
the
home
service
robots
mentioned
in
the
report
may
bring
threaten
to
owners
.
it
is
true
that
scientists
have
been
working
for
long
time
on
ai
robots
that
can
help
people
in
daily
life
.
but
what
comes
with
this
development
is
information
leaking
.
in
2017
,
ai
toy
--
my
friend
cayla
doll
was
reported
to
involve
in
private
information
recording
.
dialogues
of
thousands
of
children
who
play
with
this
doll
were
stolen
and
send
to
an
analytical
center
,
which
caused
a
wild
spread
panic
among
parents
.
worse
,
this
information
may
help
criminal
to
locate
the
address
of
children
.
though
this
information
leak
was
not
deliberately
conducted
by
toy
company
,
the
security
problems
of
ai
robots
still
happened
.
furthermore
,
i
think
that
ai
robots
need
to
be
guided
to
a
specific
target
instead
of
free-to-all
because
of
the
vulnerability
and
credulousness
of
children
and
elders
.
but
people
should
be
confident
on
ai
because
security
is
a
inevitable
part
in
development
path
of
ai
.
thus
the
monitoring
and
regulation
of
ai
companies
,
especially
those
targeted
at
children
,
should
be
intensified
and
overt
to
the
public
.
admittedly
,
people
should
embrace
the
advent
of
ai
and
participate
in
the
process
of
ai
developing
.
but
when
we
enjoy
the
benefits
ai
brings
to
our
life
,
we
should
always
be
critical
and
careful
,
especially
we
it
comes
to
education
and
life
service
.
only
under
the
guarantee
of
involving
of
important
skills
-lrb-
communication
,
cooperation
and
interaction
-rrb-
and
security
can
people
really
relish
the
world
of
ai
.
