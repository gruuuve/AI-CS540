artificial
intelligence
can
be
defined
as
a
branch
of
computer
science
dealing
with
the
replication
of
intelligent
human
-
like
behavior
in
computers
or
the
capability
of
computers
to
replicate
the
human
intelligence
.
the
article
talks
about
how
artificial
intelligence
affects
or
will
affect
the
life
of
humans
in
various
ways
.
the
article
talks
about
how
the
study
panel
doesn
t
think
that
ai
systems
can
inflict
harm
on
human
being
.
however
,
there
have
been
many
instances
where
ai
systems
may
have
taken
the
wrong
path
.
one
such
example
was
of
microsoft
chatbot
-
tay
-
where
it
started
using
abusive
language
and
even
supported
nazi
idealism
.
moreover
,
ai
is
programmed
to
do
something
beneficial
,
but
it
can
develop
a
destructive
method
to
achieve
its
goal
.
for
example
,
sofia
,
a
lifelike
android
,
in
2016
stated
that
it
would
destroy
humans
.
however
,
these
types
of
incidents
did
no
major
harm
,
but
they
did
open
the
door
of
possibilities
about
what
these
systems
can
do
in
near
future
.
another
point
mentioned
in
the
article
was
that
study
panel
was
optimistic
about
the
usage
of
self-driving
cars
.
however
,
according
to
the
recent
annual
automated
vehicle
survey
conducted
by
aaa
found
that
71
percent
of
people
are
afraid
to
ride
in
fully
self-driving
vehicles
.
these
numbers
won
t
go
down
in
near
future
for
various
reasons
.
first
,
the
most
important
reason
is
the
conventional
thinking
of
the
boomers
:
they
don
t
fully
the
ai
system
and
still
believe
that
the
conventional
way
to
drive
is
the
best
way
.
second
,
there
have
been
accidents
,
however
not
many
,
involving
the
self-driving
vehicles
.
one
such
incident
took
place
in
2016
,
when
a
self-driving
uber
car
ran
over
a
red
light
at
a
busy
pedestrian
crosswalk
during
its
real
-
world
testing
.
third
,
people
love
to
drive
and
believe
that
the
main
essence
of
the
car
would
be
lost
if
they
are
turned
into
fully
autonomous
rather
than
being
driven
by
.
the
article
also
focuses
on
how
the
development
in
artificial
intelligence
systems
may
help
in
job
creation
.
however
,
according
to
a
cnbc
survey
,
27
%
of
the
people
are
worried
that
the
artificial
intelligence
systems
may
soon
take
their
jobs
.
with
the
recent
development
in
automotive
,
business
support
and
logistics
industry
,
there
is
a
high
chance
that
people
may
lose
their
job
.
however
,
we
can
not
say
that
the
development
is
limited
to
these
industries
.
artificial
intelligence
is
also
taking
up
jobs
of
people
in
teaching
and
it
industry
too
.
microsoft
released
sketch2code
which
uses
ai
to
convert
hand-written
drawings
to
working
html
prototypes
.
this
will
revolutionize
the
front
-
end
industry
complete
but
will
also
have
a
great
impact
in
the
employment
sector
.
nonetheless
,
ai
will
help
in
creating
employment
for
people
in
sectors
.
according
to
recent
report
,
ai
may
help
in
generating
employment
for
millions
of
people
.
however
,
we
still
can
t
deny
the
fact
that
ai
will
cause
more
unemployment
than
employment
.
the
article
also
discusses
how
the
increase
in
autonomous
learning
will
lead
to
less
social
contact
among
the
students
.
this
claim
may
,
however
,
be
not
that
accurate
.
autonomous
learning
gives
the
students
the
freedom
to
study
when
they
want
ie
;
morning
,
afternoon
or
night
.
having
given
this
freedom
,
not
only
helps
them
to
be
more
productive
but
also
gives
them
free
time
.
this
free
time
can
be
utilized
by
the
children
to
hang
out
with
their
friends
.
all
in
all
,
ai
has
affected
almost
everything
around
humans
in
good
and
bad
way
both
.
it
all
depends
upon
our
approach
on
it
.
