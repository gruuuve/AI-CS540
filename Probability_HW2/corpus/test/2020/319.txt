in
this
article
,
the
author
brings
up
the
point
that
self-driving
cars
will
be
widely
available
by
2020
.
the
problem
inherent
to
that
statement
is
that
,
it
is
2020
,
and
it
's
doubtful
that
the
world
will
be
able
to
access
self-driving
cars
easily
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
despite
other
companies
attempting
to
roll
out
self-driving
,
outside
of
tesla
,
the
best
that
most
companies
have
been
able
to
solve
is
adaptive
cruise
control
on
the
highways
.
tesla
vehicles
have
been
able
to
do
some
level
of
autonomous
self-driving
,
but
it
requires
full
attention
on
the
road
and
hands
on
the
steering
wheel
,
which
,
by
definition
,
is
n't
truly
self-driving
because
it
requires
attention
from
the
driver
.
there
is
another
problem
with
tesla
being
the
only
self-driving
car
,
they
are
n't
cheap
,
taking
away
from
the
accessibility
of
the
technology
.
the
cheapest
tesla
model
is
the
model
3
,
which
at
its
default
configuration
with
white
paint
and
black
aero
wheels
is
forty
thousand
dollars
.
most
people
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
money
to
spend
on
a
small
sedan
.
this
configuration
does
not
include
self-driving
.
the
self-driving
package
is
another
three
thousand
dollars
.
the
author
claims
that
by
2030
,
we
will
have
much
more
than
autonomous
cars
,
spreading
into
flying
vehicles
as
well
as
other
larger
vehicles
.
additionally
,
it
's
too
hard
to
ensure
that
the
technology
is
ever
stable
enough
to
use
.
he
talks
about
confidence
in
autonomous
vehicles
driving
purchasing
,
however
,
the
numerous
crashes
from
hardware
and
software
defects
makes
consumer
confidence
shaky
at
best
.
there
are
more
pressing
concerns
about
self-driving
as
a
whole
.
there
's
a
large
problem
that
they
may
be
hacked
.
the
technology
is
not
stable
enough
for
there
not
to
be
security
faults
.
since
the
car
can
be
independently
controlled
,
it
makes
the
insecurity
much
worse
than
traditional
cars
.
on
an
ethical
level
,
coding
an
artificial
intelligence
program
,
especially
for
crash
avoidance
is
extremely
difficult
.
there
's
a
popular
ethical
problem
,
called
the
trolley
problem
in
which
you
are
on
a
out-of-control
trolley
,
heading
toward
one
person
you
know
on
the
tracks
with
the
choice
to
move
to
another
track
with
five
people
you
do
n't
know
.
the
ethical
ramifications
of
the
issue
at
hand
are
demonstrative
,
if
not
directly
applicable
.
if
the
car
loses
control
,
and
there
is
a
small
child
,
an
elderly
person
,
and
a
sturdy
tree
,
and
the
car
must
crash
into
one
of
them
,
which
should
it
choose
?
who
should
it
prioritize
?
it
's
these
questions
that
need
to
be
solved
before
self-driving
cars
are
ready
for
the
mass
market
.
how
does
the
car
prioritize
life
,
the
ones
in
the
car
or
the
ones
outside
?
should
it
choose
to
save
younger
or
older
?
ethical
questions
are
hard
to
raise
,
but
they
are
needed
if
the
cars
can
serve
a
global
market
.
in
places
like
indian
cities
,
where
traffic
congestion
is
almost
awe-inspiring
,
how
does
a
car
navigate
tight
turns
with
little
to
no
space
in
the
turning
radius
?
self-driving
cars
only
work
if
everything
also
drives
perfectly
.
if
there
is
even
one
driver
that
is
n't
driving
perfectly
,
then
the
system
goes
askew
.
self-driving
cars
are
n't
ready
now
,
and
the
author
would
be
hasty
to
say
they
'll
be
ready
in
ten
years
.
