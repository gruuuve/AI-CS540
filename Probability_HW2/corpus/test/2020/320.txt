with
ai
becoming
more
and
more
prominent
in
the
daily
life
of
americans
,
it
poses
some
issues
on
the
future
of
ai
.
the
article
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
delves
into
topics
on
the
future
of
life
with
ai
.
although
it
mentions
many
interesting
subjects
,
i
find
it
rather
optimistic
when
it
describes
the
future
of
transportation
in
2030
,
especially
relating
to
the
mainstream
of
autonomous
cars
.
despite
the
general
public
having
an
increasing
acceptance
of
self-driving
cars
in
the
previous
years
,
it
is
unrealistic
that
by
2030
,
in
just
ten
short
years
,
these
vehicles
will
have
taken
over
the
roads
.
the
first
reason
for
this
is
the
natural
human
desire
for
control
.
many
humans
want
to
be
in
control
,
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
dangerous
act
of
driving
a
car
.
the
vast
majority
of
humans
want
to
be
in
control
of
the
steering
well
and
to
make
decisions
for
themselves
.
when
traveling
on
highways
of
speeds
of
up
to
80mph
,
one
slight
miscalculation
could
be
the
difference
between
life
and
death
.
therefore
,
experienced
human
drivers
want
to
be
in
charge
of
their
life
and
their
families
,
instead
of
an
autonomous
car
.
humans
are
also
able
to
detect
things
that
some
sensors
can
not
.
for
example
,
humans
may
be
able
to
detect
a
small
patch
of
ice
that
never
alerted
any
of
the
sensors
on
a
self-driving
car
.
also
,
humans
might
be
able
to
see
another
car
's
wheels
starting
to
skid
a
couple
lanes
away
from
them
before
the
sensors
do
.
these
detections
done
by
humans
might
give
them
a
split
second
to
react
faster
than
an
autonomous
car
would
be
able
to
,
potentially
saving
their
life
.
the
second
reason
why
i
believe
autonomous
cars
will
not
take
over
the
roads
by
2030
is
the
lack
of
companies
that
are
currently
selling
a
significant
number
of
autonomous
cars
and
the
cost
to
buy
one
.
when
people
today
think
of
self-driving
cars
the
most
common
company
that
comes
to
mind
is
most
likely
tesla
.
although
other
companies
have
autonomous
cars
for
sale
,
tesla
is
by
far
the
most
popular
dealer
.
thus
,
if
there
is
only
one
company
that
is
widely
recognized
by
the
general
public
for
autonomous
cars
today
,
it
would
seem
to
be
unrealistic
that
in
10
years
these
cars
will
be
dominating
the
road
.
additionally
,
the
cost
of
these
self-driving
cars
is
more
expensive
than
their
human
driving
counterparts
,
which
is
another
discouraging
factor
.
with
cars
becoming
longer
lasting
and
more
expensive
in
general
,
there
has
been
a
surge
in
the
number
of
people
who
are
buying
used
cars
.
therefore
,
many
people
who
have
recently
bought
either
a
new
or
used
car
within
the
last
few
years
will
still
be
using
this
same
car
in
2030
and
will
have
no
motivation
to
go
out
and
make
another
expensive
purchase
on
a
car
when
they
do
not
need
too
.
surely
the
interest
and
use
of
self-driving
cars
will
most
likely
rise
each
year
,
however
it
is
very
unlikely
that
by
the
year
2030
,
the
average
american
city
will
be
dominated
by
self-driving
vehicles
.
