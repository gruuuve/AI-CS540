the
ai
100
paper
has
a
general
overview
of
ai
,
how
to
define
ai
,
ai
in
specific
domains
,
and
recommendations
for
ai
public
policy
.
throughout
the
writing
,
specifically
in
the
general
overview
,
the
authors
of
the
ai
100
paper
make
some
pretty
hefty
claims
that
i
do
not
agree
with
.
in
the
general
overview
on
page
4
,
the
ai
100
makes
this
claim
:
computer
vision
and
ai
planning
,
for
example
,
drive
the
video
games
that
are
now
a
bigger
entertainment
industry
than
hollywood
.
there
are
two
main
issues
i
have
with
this
grand
statement
.
first
is
the
fact
that
there
are
no
triple
a
video
game
titles
that
are
using
ai
.
now
one
can
argue
that
for
non-player
characters
or
bots
use
a
rudimentary
style
of
ai
.
what
is
different
though
is
that
the
bots
use
an
ai
that
is
made
to
not
be
good
,
but
to
allow
the
human
player
to
have
a
good
experience
.
the
ai
100
article
just
points
to
cases
of
ai
where
the
ai
is
an
active
threat
to
the
human
player
completely
winning
the
game
.
even
though
these
single
player
or
co-op
games
may
have
this
weird
unmentioned
style
of
ai
,
most
games
are
not
even
single
player
or
co-op
and
do
not
use
any
bots
.
the
games
that
are
driving
the
video
game
industry
are
primarily
online
multiplayer
titles
such
as
counter
strike
:
global
offensive
,
player
unknown
s
battleground
,
league
of
legends
,
roblox
,
rocket
league
,
overwatch
,
fortnite
,
and
dota
2
.
keeping
to
the
entertainment
aspect
of
ai
,
the
ai
100
paper
also
talks
about
how
entertainment
will
get
more
personalized
on
page
8
:
ai
will
increasingly
enable
entertainment
that
is
more
interactive
,
personalized
,
and
engaging
.
what
i
find
unnerving
is
that
they
go
on
to
say
,
research
should
be
directed
toward
understanding
how
to
leverage
these
attributes
for
individuals
and
society
s
benefit
.
now
yes
,
they
are
completely
right
that
that
research
should
be
done
to
leverage
this
for
society
s
benefit
,
but
i
struggle
to
see
that
this
is
something
that
can
happen
.
as
soon
as
some
company
makes
some
form
of
entertainment
,
let
s
say
a
video
game
,
that
can
completely
personalize
itself
for
the
specific
user
,
that
video
game
will
be
a
hot
seller
.
we
are
now
letting
this
one
company
control
how
society
spends
its
time
,
and
if
the
game
is
so
good
,
other
forms
of
entertainment
would
decrease
,
especially
ones
that
involve
actual
human
interactions
.
i
personally
can
not
see
an
actual
future
with
large
companies
trying
to
make
money
using
ai
in
a
responsible
matter
.
we
have
already
seen
facebook
lead
a
social
media
revolution
that
personalizes
people
s
news
feed
,
which
destroyed
self-confidence
and
human
face
to
face
discussion
.
this
leads
me
to
another
point
of
disagreement
i
have
with
this
paper
.
the
authors
of
the
ai
100
paper
act
like
it
is
the
worst
thing
to
stifle
the
adoption
and
development
of
ai
:
a
vigorous
and
informed
debate
about
how
to
best
steer
ai
in
ways
that
enrich
our
lives
and
our
society
,
while
encouraging
creativity
in
the
field
,
is
an
urgent
and
vital
need
.

i
don
t
think
,
especially
with
my
example
of
personalized
entertainment
,
that
ai
is
an
urgent
and
vital
need
.
what
we
should
do
instead
is
allow
academia
surrounding
ai
to
become
mature
,
then
allow
it
to
seep
into
public
policy
before
bringing
it
to
the
masses
of
the
people
.
ai
needs
to
be
heavily
regulated
to
prevent
the
misuse
and
or
detrimental
use
by
large
companies
for
the
wellbeing
of
society
.
