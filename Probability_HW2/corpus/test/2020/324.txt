challenges
to
the
ai
report
the
author
tries
to
state
what
ai
will
impact
society
in
the
future
,
but
it
has
several
points
needed
to
be
discussed
.
as
mentioned
in
the
report
,
ai
is
likely
to
help
low-resource
communities
potentially
and
will
hurt
society
's
well-being
in
the
long
,
which
i
disagree
on
.
the
report
mentions
that
ai
can
help
improving
citizens
of
low-resource
communities
with
focus
on
environmental
protection
and
social
influential
.
however
,
it
is
quite
questionable
when
it
comes
to
actual
implementation
.
as
we
all
know
,
ai
technology
needs
tremendous
resources
when
it
comes
to
reality
:
computational
resources
,
highly
skilled
technicians
,
massive
data
set
to
be
studied
.
all
of
those
resources
need
huge
amount
of
investment
which
low-resource
communities
is
likely
lack
of
.
it
could
be
true
that
government
can
help
low-resource
communities
,
but
all
the
benefits
comes
from
taxes
and
loans
.
thus
,
low-resource
communities
could
not
afford
such
service
though
it
means
to
help
those
communities
.
however
,
some
will
claim
that
big
companies
could
afford
and
help
investing
in
ai
technology
in
those
communities
.
it
is
certainly
a
solution
but
has
its
own
drawback
.
as
we
all
know
that
ai
usually
require
a
lot
of
data
set
to
train
on
.
once
the
big
companies
acquire
those
data
set
,
which
could
be
credential
health
and
environmental
information
or
private
social
network
information
,
it
is
hard
for
people
to
guarantee
that
those
companies
wo
n't
do
anything
harmful
to
the
society
.
big
companies
could
easily
exert
their
influence
if
they
have
enough
data
about
a
society
.
an
example
for
that
will
be
cambridge
analytica
works
for
brexit
and
substantially
impact
the
vote
.
if
government
fails
to
regulate
on
those
big
companies
,
it
will
be
a
crisis
for
information
security
in
the
society
.
besides
improving
low-resource
communities
,
the
report
also
suggests
ai
will
change
another
aspect
of
society
:
employment
.
the
report
makes
prediction
that
ai
will
bring
more
jobs
in
the
short
term
while
hurt
interest
of
majority
people
in
the
society
,
especially
whose
jobs
are
diminished
by
ai
's
upsurge
.
i
would
not
agree
on
the
second
viewpoint
.
the
world
has
been
witnessed
three
technology
evolutions
,
but
none
of
those
diminish
new
jobs
or
majority
's
interest
.
people
nowadays
have
more
jobs
and
social
benefits
comparing
to
18th
century
when
steam
machine
was
invented
.
in
the
past
,
transportation
is
largely
confined
to
simple
methods
,
either
by
manual
power
or
by
nature
and
animals
.
however
,
airplanes
,
buses
,
taxis
are
now
creating
more
jobs
than
ancient
transport
.
it
is
same
with
ai
.
certainly
,
there
will
more
jobs
available
as
new
technology
evolves
.
there
will
be
more
needs
in
teachers
to
trained
up
young
kids
to
equipped
with
newest
ai
technology
.
more
specific
and
customized
needs
of
ai
will
be
applied
in
households
and
enterprise
and
people
need
more
ai
experts
to
deal
with
personalized
planning
and
health
guidance
.
as
ai
is
getting
into
almost
every
industry
,
there
will
be
needs
of
expert
of
cross-field
knowledge
to
update
and
transform
old
generation
technology
.
opportunities
will
be
abundant
and
society
would
get
more
advanced
and
wealth
not
only
for
rich
people
,
but
also
for
the
ordinary
.
