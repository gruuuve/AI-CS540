ai
in
policing
:
restating
the
need
for
open
source
software
although
future
ai
may
be
used
to
create
a
more
fair
,
balanced
and
trustworthy
legal
system
,
at
the
current
time
ai
presents
far
more
challenges
than
it
solves
and
should
be
removed
from
policing
systems
.
perhaps
one
of
the
chief
issues
with
the
stanford
report
is
not
that
it
states
anything
blatantly
factually
dishonest
,
but
that
it
fails
to
recognize
the
critical
importance
of
maintaining
transparency
within
ai
utilized
in
the
judicial
system
.
while
many
people
would
balk
at
the
notion
of
conducting
secret
court
meetings
to
determine
the
innocence
of
a
citizen
,
closed
source
current
implementations
of
ai
utilized
in
policing
environments
essentially
accomplish
the
same
thing
.
unfortunately
for
the
civil
liberties
of
citizens
,
poorly
designed
closed
source
ai
policing
implementations
have
the
potential
to
destroy
the
human
right
of
a
fair
trial
to
determine
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
an
individual
.
considering
the
dystopian
consequences
of
the
aforementioned
scenario
,
it
seems
paramount
to
keep
ai
out
of
the
justice
system
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
citizens
.
however
,
many
governments
have
already
begun
to
employ
ai
in
an
unprincipled
or
nefarious
manner
.
in
this
category
,
the
most
blatant
governmental
offender
is
china
in
regards
to
the
ongoing
hong
kong
sovereignty
movement
.
although
clashes
between
protestors
and
police
have
turned
violent
,
protests
within
the
movement
started
peacefully

and

.
even
though
there
are
many
complex
cultural
and
political
factors
surrounding
this
event
,
the
key
takeaway
is
the
prevalent
use
of
ai
driven
facial
identification
to
identify
protesters
within
the
free
hong
kong
movement
.
the
practice
became
so
commonly
used
that
activists
began
wearing
facial
masks
to
help
conceal
their
identity
,
which
lead
to
direct
intervention
from
the
greater
chinese
government
to
temporarily
ban
marks
within
hong
kong
-lrb-
yu
-rrb-
.
while
this
case
displays
obvious
misuse
of
ai
driven
facial
recognition
to
suppress
freedom
of
expression
other
governments
have
also
used
ai
based
facial
identification
in
non
ideal
ways
.
one
such
government
is
the
united
kingdom
.
although
police
departments
within
the
uk
have
thankfully
not
used
ai
to
quell
free
speech
,
they
have
used
ai
based
facial
recognition
to
assist
policing
despite
it
being
ridiculously
inaccurate
.
for
instance
,
police
in
leicestershire
used
facial
recognition
despite
it
having
over
a
90
%
false
positive
rate
-lrb-
burgess
-rrb-
.
furthermore
,
the
london
police
also
used
ai
driven
facial
recognition
systems
at
large
public
events
in
2016
and
2017
,
despite
it
having
a
98
%
failure
rate
in
some
instances
-lrb-
burgess
-rrb-
.
thankfully
,
since
this
is
obviously
well
beyond
any
reasonable
false
positive
rate
,
the
london
police
department
has
recently
adopted
a
more
cautious
use
of
ai
.
hopefully
,
in
order
to
protect
the
freedoms
of
english
citizens
,
the
london
police
department
continues
this
careful
approach
in
the
future
in
order
to
avoid
unjust
and
unfair
issues
in
the
future
.
even
though
ai
may
prove
useful
in
the
future
in
promoting
a
more
fair
and
balanced
policing
system
in
society
,
current
implementations
of
ai
based
utilities
should
be
avoided
.
since
governments
should
in
part
function
to
protect
the
civil
liberties
of
its
citizenry
,
the
use
of
ai
should
be
suspended
within
judicial
environments
until
ai
can
be
proven
to
operate
with
minimal
error
.
furthermore
,
future
ai
based
methods
of
policing
should
strive
to
be
open
source
in
order
to
ensure
that
researchers
and
public
officials
can
verify
that
ai
applications
are
operating
justly
as
intended
.
although
ai
promises
to
offer
great
things
to
humanity
in
the
future
,
a
cautious
and
rational
approach
to
ai
needs
to
be
taken
to
guarantee
a
better
future
for
everyone
.
