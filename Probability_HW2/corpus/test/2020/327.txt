this
short
essay
will
attempt
to
challenge
the
notion
that
regulatory
and
commercial
obstacles
need
merely
be
removed
in
order
to
promote
the
pace
of
development
for
ai
technologies
in
healthcare
,
as
laid
out
in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
.
the
report
does
an
excellent
job
of
noting
the
likely
keys
for
success
for
ai
based
technologies
in
healthcare
as
the
volume
and
quality
of
data
on
page
25
.
nearly
all
of
the
developing
methods
listed
in
the
research
trends
section
of
the
report
benefit
from
more
and
better
labeled
training
data
.
the
report
goes
on
to
list
the
fda
and
hipaa
-lrb-
and
presumably
by
extension
the
hitec
act
of
2009
-lrb-
2
-rrb-
-rrb-
as
specific
barriers
to
obtaining
this
volume
and
quality
of
data
.
this
is
,
unfortunately
,
a
potentially
poorly
framed
narrative
that
makes
the
fda
and
hipaa
the
enemy
of
ai
progress
.
the
fda
and
department
of
health
and
human
services
-lrb-
hhs
-rrb-
,
are
operating
in
an
environment
where
citizens
are
saying
that
the
use
or
disclosure
of
their
health
information
can
have
life
altering
consequences
;
concerns
that
may
be
justified
.
it
is
also
unfortunate
that
partly
due
to
ai
technologies
,
it
is
increasingly
possible
to
identify
individuals
based
on
their
data
-lrb-
3
-rrb-
,
which
bad
actors
can
then
use
to
target
or
discriminate
against
those
individuals
.
the
incentives
of
insurance
companies
and
the
insured
,
for
example
,
are
exactly
opposed
,
and
there
is
extreme
financial
incentive
for
an
insurance
company
to
know
as
many
of
the
potential
risk
factors
for
coverage
as
possible
.
it
is
likely
much
more
helpful
to
realize
that
these
regulations
exist
due
to
the
power
of
potential
bad
actors
,
and
the
general
confusion
over
the
potential
benefits
that
may
arise
from
allowing
ai
technologies
to
access
healthcare
data
.
it
should
be
somewhat
obvious
that
it
is
the
consent
of
the
individual
whose
data
would
benefit
the
ai
technology
that
should
be
sought
,
rather
than
the
dismantling
of
the
regulatory
framework
which
protects
that
information
.
if
private
or
public
entities
wish
to
use
the
vast
amount
of
healthcare
data
that
is
being
generated
daily
,
then
it
is
critical
for
those
entities
to
inform
individuals
of
the
benefits
of
releasing
their
data
,
and
to
get
their
consent
.
as
cited
in
the
stanford
report
,
individuals
have
had
success
mining
social
media
data
for
potential
health
risks
,
which
would
be
a
success
of
ai
,
but
the
public
perception
of
this
success
can
be
viewed
as
invasive
or
unwanted
.
an
example
was
the
revelation
that
religious
language
like
``
god
''
or
``
pray
''
corresponded
to
a
15
fold
increase
in
risk
for
diabetes
based
on
facebook
content
-lrb-
4
-rrb-
.
the
same
study
showed
that
there
were
some
conditions
which
facebook
content
predicted
better
than
demographic
information
,
which
highlights
the
power
of
data
in
informing
healthcare
.
the
stanford
report
,
it
should
be
noted
,
also
mentions
the
unfortunate
power
of
a
limited
number
of
electronic
health
record
-lrb-
ehr
-rrb-
companies
whose
interfaces
,
and
rigid
need
for
compliance
with
the
existing
regulations
have
limited
the
promise
of
new
ai-based
analytics
.
in
terms
of
the
regulatory
and
commercial
obstacles
to
be
overcome
,
these
should
be
the
primary
targets
,
rather
than
the
broader
rules
that
seek
to
protect
citizens
from
bad
actors
.
