after
reading
the
52-page
long
paper
regarding
the
prospect
of
artificial
intelligence
,
i
agreed
on
many
perspectives
the
author
holds
,
such
as
the
potential
usage
of
artificial
intelligence
on
different
aspects
of
our
society
.
however
,
i
ca
n't
agree
on
two
perspectives
mentioned
in
author
's
paper
.
first
of
all
,
the
author
mentioned
on
page
43
that
the
government
should
remove
the
restrictions
of
some
federal
laws
on
the
research
on
artificial
intelligence
.
the
original
purpose
of
the
author
is
well-meaning
.
however
,
such
removal
of
existing
restrictions
may
cause
severe
side
effects
,
such
as
the
potential
rebellion
of
artificial
intelligence
.
the
current
laws
are
the
base
line
that
prevents
artificial
intelligence
to
be
harmful
for
its
creator
,
which
is
human
being
.
if
such
basic
laws
are
removed
,
then
there
will
be
completely
no
control
on
the
development
of
artificial
intelligence
,
which
will
be
extremely
dangerous
for
our
society
.
just
imageine
that
without
the
control
of
basic
laws
on
the
development
of
artificial
intelligence
,
the
scene
in
the
science
fiction
about
artificial
intelligence
rebellion
may
become
true
.
in
this
way
,
the
basic
laws
and
restrictions
on
artificial
intelligence
is
very
important
.
although
the
removal
of
some
federal
laws
can
be
beneficial
for
the
reverse
engineering
of
artificial
intelligence
,
the
following
side
effect
is
far
beyond
we
can
afford
.
as
the
result
,
the
author
's
proposal
of
eliminating
some
federal
laws
that
controls
the
guidelines
of
the
development
of
artificial
intelligence
can
not
be
supported
by
my
reasoning
.
what
's
more
,
the
author
mentioned
mobile
health
as
the
future
domain
that
artificial
intelligence
may
be
used
.
admittedly
,
the
usage
of
artificial
intelligence
may
reduce
the
danger
of
potential
disease
of
mobile
users
by
detecting
the
disease
in
advance
,
such
as
depression
issue
.
however
,
such
detection
and
data
collection
can
cause
severe
issues
,
such
as
data
leaking
and
endanger
of
user
privacy
.
mobile
health
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
artificial
intelligence
can
take
control
of
the
data
of
the
user
by
downloading
the
specific
app
on
the
mobile
device
.
in
this
way
,
artificial
intelligence
are
controlling
the
personal
data
of
users
,
and
the
leaking
of
such
data
may
greatly
endanger
the
privacy
of
users
.
for
example
,
in
the
case
that
the
user
may
develop
depression
issues
,
and
the
artificial
intelligence
moniters
all
the
data
in
user
's
app
and
predict
that
the
user
's
potential
disease
.
if
such
personal
data
got
leaked
due
to
lack
of
security
system
or
software
malfunction
,
the
user
's
mental
health
may
be
negatively
affacted
since
depression
issue
is
a
personal
mental
condition
.
