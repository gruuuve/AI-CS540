the
article
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
talks
about
the
development
and
progress
artificial
intelligence
would
have
in
the
future
.
in
addition
to
explaining
what
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
is
and
giving
examples
of
its
applications
in
the
real
world
,
the
authors
throw
light
on
issues
like
government
policies
that
affect
ai
's
future
.
the
article
states
that
``
transportation
is
likely
to
be
one
of
the
first
domains
in
which
the
general
public
will
be
asked
to
trust
the
reliability
and
safety
of
an
ai
system
for
a
critical
task
.
''
while
the
widespread
perception
of
people
is
that
fully
automated
cars
will
be
on
road
in
the
near
future
,
it
is
very
unlikely
.
level
3
and
level
4
automation
have
picked
up
momentum
in
the
recent
years
but
,
moving
to
level
5
automation
of
the
cars
-lrb-
fully
automatic
-rrb-
has
many
challenges
that
are
not
yet
being
considered
.
researchers
have
been
neglecting
the
fact
that
in
several
countries
,
the
way
traffic
moves
is
very
different
than
united
states
or
china
.
the
technology
that
has
been
building
does
not
seem
to
be
versatile
enough
to
have
real
functionality
around
the
world
.
if
automated
cars
do
take
the
road
by
2030
,
the
likelihood
of
them
being
usable
everywhere
in
the
world
is
slim
.
with
accidents
like
the
one
google
had
in
which
a
person
was
killed
by
a
fully
automatic
car
,
the
progress
in
this
field
keeps
taking
halts
that
affect
the
general
pace
of
the
it
industry
.
due
to
this
and
many
other
factors
,
it
companies
keep
facing
criticism
by
governments
across
the
world
.
recently
,
mark
zuckerberg
was
questioned
by
the
congress
about
what
facebook
does
with
the
user
data
.
many
of
these
questions
did
not
make
sense
and
showed
everyone
in
the
it
industry
that
people
do
not
understand
computer
science
and
are
afraid
of
change
.
it
is
unfortunate
but
,
politics
has
posed
new
challenges
for
it
companies
to
tackle
like
privacy
issues
and
the
general
spread
of
misinformation
about
how
it
companies
use
people
's
data
.
if
the
car
industry
moves
to
using
iot
in
the
devices
for
inter-vehicular
communication
,
there
might
be
another
uproar
asking
about
its
integrity
in
terms
of
how
data
gathered
from
the
cars
is
being
used
by
the
companies
.
while
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
,
data
being
an
asset
is
always
valued
by
companies
and
thus
they
try
to
monetize
it
.
if
this
happens
,
that
will
again
slow
down
development
in
the
domain
of
automated
cars
.
meanwhile
,
general
public
has
been
interacting
with
ai
every
day
,
all
the
time
for
a
few
years
now
.
with
assistants
like
siri
and
alexa
,
the
reach
ai
has
on
people
has
escalated
in
the
past
decade
and
most
people
have
appreciated
it
.
every
device
has
some
sort
of
ai
driving
it
,
even
watches
,
door
locks
,
refrigerators
etc.
which
helps
the
operation
of
that
device
.
ai
has
also
been
one
of
the
biggest
drivers
in
the
ad
industry
and
thus
all
sorts
of
media
.
people
have
been
using
ai
to
make
music
for
a
while
now
and
would
not
realize
the
role
ai
is
playing
in
that
.
the
future
of
the
transportation
industry
looks
bright
,
but
far
.
while
it
may
not
be
one
of
the
first
domains
of
ai
to
gain
popularity
and
acceptance
,
it
will
be
real
in
the
future
.
