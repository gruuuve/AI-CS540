reflection
i
disagree
with
the
authors
of
the
article
when
they
say
that
transportation
is
likely
to
be
one
of
the
first
domains
in
which
the
general
public
will
be
asked
to
trust
the
reliability
and
safety
of
an
ai
system
for
a
critical
task

i
believe
ai
usage
in
the
healthcare
fields
are
more
likely
to
become
utilized
by
the
general
public
at
a
quicker
pace
than
ai
usage
in
the
transportation
field
.
the
main
reason
i
believe
this
is
because
of
the
numerous
ethical
,
public
relations
,
and
safety
dilemmas
that
can
arise
from
ai
usage
in
the
transportation
field
which
are
more
easily
avoided
in
the
healthcare
field
through
the
presence
of
waivers
.
it
is
no
secret
that
self-driving
cars
have
dozens
of
foreseeable
issues
that
have
still
not
yet
been
solved
.
for
example
,
there
is
a
clear
lack
of
responsibility
for
the
person
at
fault
in
self-driving
automobile
accidents
.
there
has
not
been
clear
legislation
made
for
who
the
blame
lies
on
and
who
should
pay
for
damages
and
reparations
.
another
example
is
the
mass
skepticism
that
the
general
public
still
has
over
the
reliability
of
self-driving
cars
.
according
to
polls
conducted
by
the
advocates
for
highway
and
auto
safety
,
a
whopping
64
%
of
americans
are
skeptical
about
being
on
the
road
with
fully
self-driving
vehicles
.
the
survey
also
found
that
31
%
of
drivers
were
very
concerned
about
sharing
the
road
with
self-driving
vehicles
and
a
further
33
%
were
at
least
somewhat
concerned
.
with
such
a
low
public
opinion
of
the
reliability
and
safety
of
ai-controlled
cars
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
convince
society
that
these
types
of
cars
are
worth
risking
their
lives
on
.
on
top
of
that
,
every
ai-related
automobile
accident
,
which
are
certain
to
occur
,
could
delay
the
release
of
the
self-driving
car
for
several
years
and
cause
further
damage
to
public
opinion
.
a
final
example
could
be
the
safety
of
the
self-driving
cars
with
regards
to
hackers
.
in
2015
,
two
researchers
,
charlie
miller
and
chris
valasek
,
proved
they
could
remotely
hack
into
an
automated
jeep
cherokee
and
control
its
steering
,
transmission
,
and
braking
.
this
is
also
a
cause
for
concern
because
of
the
dangers
that
come
with
an
entirely
automated
system
which
the
driver
has
no
control
over
in
the
case
of
a
security
breach
,
which
could
occur
.
while
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
we
will
be
able
to
develop
solutions
for
these
problems
with
time
,
in
the
healthcare
field
these
problems
are
much
less
of
an
issue
due
to
the
presence
of
waivers
.
on
the
road
,
everyone
is
impacted
by
self-driving
cars
,
whether
they
drive
one
or
not
.
this
means
that
for
self-driving
cars
to
become
commonplace
,
there
will
need
to
be
widespread
acceptance
of
ai-controlled
cars
.
everyone
,
or
at
least
a
large
majority
of
people
,
will
need
to
agree
to
sharing
the
road
with
self-driving
cars
.
in
contrast
,
healthcare
procedures
such
as
ai-controlled
surgeries
are
individualized
.
they
affect
and
operate
on
a
single
person
,
who
can
simply
be
asked
to
sign
a
waiver
to
protect
the
hospital
and
equipment
manufacturer
from
responsibility
for
damages
.
artificial
intelligence
in
the
healthcare
field
might
experience
the
same
ethical
,
public
relations
,
and
safety
issues
as
vehicles
in
the
transportation
field
,
but
the
individualized
aspect
of
the
healthcare
field
removes
many
of
the
largest
roadblocks
to
widespread
usage
outside
of
the
actual
coding
implementation
.
thus
,
i
believe
that
healthcare
,
not
transportation
,
is
more
likely
to
be
the
first
domain
in
which
the
general
public
will
be
asked
to
trust
the
reliability
and
safety
of
an
ai
system
for
a
critical
task
