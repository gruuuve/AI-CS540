the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
seeks
to
provide
a
comprehensive
explanation
of
the
impacts
of
ai
over
the
past
15
years
and
also
forecasts
that
it
will
evolve
over
the
next
15
years
in
some
of
the
most
relevant
areas
of
social
,
technological
and
cultural
development
.
as
per
the
report
,
ai
has
made
a
significant
leap
in
the
transportation
,
healthcare
and
safety
domains
.
howsoever
,
it
's
acceptance
still
depends
on
how
it
's
perceived
by
the
majority
of
population
which
may
make
it
difficult
for
ai
to
replace
humans
in
the
above-mentioned
domains
.
the
article
discusses
how
the
attitude
of
the
society
toward
ai
can
affect
its
creation

the
article
argues
that
if
the
community
remains
open
to
the
development
of
ai
then
it
can
boom
otherwise
the
advancement
of
ai
may
become
slow
or
stagnant
.
howsoever
,
it
may
also
rely
on
how
the
technology
was
introduced
to
the
people
.
if
introduced
in
such
a
way
that
people
do
n't
see
any
threat
from
ai
and
can
clearly
see
the
benefit
it
entails
,
then
there
wo
n't
be
any
resistance
and
it
will
consequently
speed-up
the
process
.
there
has
been
significant
development
in
transportation
with
the
advancements
in
ai
in
terms
of
speed
and
automation

self-driving
cars
are
already
being
tested
on
real
roads
and
traffic
to
see
how
they
would
act
out
in
the
real
world
.
in
addition
to
that
,
almost
all
new
cars
are
equipped
with
various
ai
enabled
technologies
such
as
speed
monitoring
and
lane
assist
.
all
these
developments
are
already
making
people
comfortable
with
the
new
tech
and
is
making
them
less
fearful
of
it
,
if
presented
correctly
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
the
same
development
is
propagated
as
a
cause
for
driver
unemployment
or
how
a
malfunctioning
car
can
cause
a
major
accident
,
then
it
may
give
rise
to
negative
opinions
.
therefore
,
an
impartial
report
that
justifies
the
reasons
behind
the
malfunction
and
fosters
the
advantages
of
ai
in
everyday
life
will
promote
acceptance
in
public
.
similarly
,
healthcare
industry
has
experienced
marvelous
development
with
the
collection
of
health
data
of
millions
of
people
from
their
personal
monitoring
devices
,
mobile
phones
and
from
electronic
health
records

this
availability
of
data
has
helped
develop
and
train
the
ai
technology
to
be
more
accurate
.
howsoever
,
replacing
human
beings
from
the
face
of
health
care
system
is
a
difficult
step
because
it
will
require
the
trust
of
doctors
and
patients
and
some
changes
in
the
regulatory
policies
of
the
healthcare
system
.
ai
has
definitely
helped
doctors
identify
diseases
.
robots
are
useful
during
surgery
because
of
precision
but
it
is
a
difficult
job
to
replace
humans
because
the
robots
lack
the
compassion
and
the
communication
skills
which
are
a
requirement
in
the
healthcare
industry
.
moreover
,
the
governments
have
been
skeptical
about
self-driving
cars
itself
.
therefore
,
convincing
the
government
to
include
robots
in
the
operation
theater
would
require
some
really
strong
points
.
moreover
,
a
medical
professional
must
have
a
clear
understanding
of
a
slightly
darker
smudge
seen
on
the
liver
to
classify
it
as
a
tumor
.
therefore
,
ai
must
be
equipped
to
be
more
reliable
than
a
human
's
decision-making
process
and
it
should
also
have
a
vision
compared
to
a
human
eye
to
be
included
in
the
healthcare
industry
.
thus
,
developing
an
accurate
and
precise
ai
tool
,
winning
the
trust
of
people
and
regulating
government
policies
may
slow
down
the
advancement
of
ai
into
healthcare
.
to
conclude
,
ai
has
made
great
strides
to
improve
the
lives
of
human
beings
.
ai
tools
are
somehow
nearly
a
part
of
everybody
's
life
,
but
it
will
take
some
time
to
be
accepted
in
every
aspect
of
human
life
.
