``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
thoroughly
explores
the
current
status
of
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
as
well
as
its
various
effects
on
human
life
.
the
report
asserts
many
statements
regarding
ai
based
on
the
professional
input
of
many
qualified
experts
,
referencing
dozens
of
reputable
sources
.
despite
all
of
this
,
some
of
the
statements
are
not
completely
convincing
.
it
is
doubtful
that
self-driving
cars
will
be
the
norm
by
2030
-lrb-
p.
20
-rrb-
.
it
is
unclear
exactly
how
artificial
intelligence
will
be
allocated
to
helping
low-resource
communities
-lrb-
p.
35
-rrb-
.
and
the
assertion
that
ai
can
remove
human
bias
is
lacking
in
supporting
evidence
-lrb-
p.
37
-rrb-
.
firstly
,
autonomous
vehicles
are
still
a
very
foreign
concept
to
the
average
person
.
exposure
to
these
vehicles
is
generally
from
movies
or
when
it
's
in
the
news
-lrb-
more
likely
from
an
accident
or
failure
than
a
positive
occurrence
-rrb-
.
to
jump
from
such
limited
exposure
to
being
the
primary
mode
of
transportation
in
the
short
period
of
10
years
from
now
is
highly
unlikely
.
gaining
the
trust
of
the
public
will
require
an
increased
public
understanding
of
the
technology
,
definitive
proof
of
increased
safety
as
well
as
efficiency
,
and
the
endorsement
of
influential
individuals
and
brands
.
this
kind
of
shift
in
public
opinion
may
take
decades
,
not
to
mention
the
modifications
to
regulation
that
will
have
to
pass
through
several
layers
of
bureaucratic
obstacles
.
secondly
,
low-resource
communities
do
n't
provide
sufficient
incentive
to
receive
the
expensive
resource
of
ai
.
the
development
of
this
highly
specialized
technology
is
very
expensive
,
and
therefore
its
deployment
and
distribution
will
be
overseen
by
the
largest
stakeholders
that
want
to
see
a
return
on
their
investments
.
providing
aid
to
low-resource
communities
,
while
a
very
worthwhile
task
that
can
benefit
countless
in
need
,
may
be
overlooked
as
these
communities
are
less
likely
to
create
the
economic
incentive
to
those
in
control
of
the
ai
.
ai
's
ability
to
help
is
undeniable
,
but
the
likelihood
such
practices
will
be
applied
by
2030
remains
unproven
.
lastly
,
artificial
intelligence
will
be
difficult
to
separate
from
the
biases
of
its
creators
and
the
creators
of
the
data
it
learns
from
.
humans
are
inherently
biased
,
despite
being
aware
of
such
biases
.
the
notion
that
these
biases
will
propagate
to
the
artificial
intelligence
made
by
humans
is
a
common
one
and
is
addressed
in
the
report
.
the
difficulty
is
in
how
the
ai
learns
from
these
large
datasets
,
ones
that
are
also
made
by
humans
with
biases
.
with
the
programmer
's
biases
and
the
data
collector
's
biases
present
,
it
is
doubtful
that
ai
can
be
completely
divorced
from
any
human
bias
as
the
report
claims
.
an
important
distinction
is
the
ai
may
be
at
least
less
biased
than
its
human
counterparts
,
which
is
still
an
improvement
.
new
possibilities
are
available
thanks
to
ai
,
possibilities
that
can
exponentially
improve
the
lives
of
billions
.
with
these
new
possibilities
come
new
challenges
.
the
technological
revolution
is
still
underway
,
and
its
practices
will
slowly
become
taken
for
granted
and
engrained
in
our
culture
.
autonomous
cars
likely
will
be
the
norm
one
day
,
given
the
time
to
organically
integrate
with
the
existing
infrastructure
.
low-resource
communities
will
benefit
from
ai
when
ai
progresses
to
the
point
that
lower
priority
projects
can
financially-justifiably
receive
attention
.
perhaps
ai
even
can
act
completely
without
bias
,
given
enough
time
.
the
report
provides
a
useful
,
complex
insight
to
all
of
these
issues
,
even
if
some
statements
are
na√Øve
in
their
expected
timeline
.
