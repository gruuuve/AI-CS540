to
begin
,
i
am
a
huge
star
wars
fan
and
the
famous
droid
duo
of
r2-d2
and
c-3po
are
one
of
the
many
reasons
i
came
to
love
star
wars
.
the
duo
are
droids
who
have
their
own
personality
and
truly
a
mind
of
their
own
,
and
i
thought
it
would
always
be
awesome
to
have
droids
like
r2-d2
and
c-3po
,
but
the
plausibility
of
having
them
seemed
unrealistic
in
the
future
.
excitingly
,
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
has
been
rapidly
expanding
at
a
rate
i
thought
we
wouldn
t
see
for
many
decades
.
how
close
is
society
to
having
robots
take
over
a
majority
of
the
work
,
having
computers
have
their
own
minds
and
their
own
personality
?
the
article
states
that
there
are
no
droid
armies
trying
to
take
over
the
galaxy
,
and
that
the
film
industry
has
imagined
current
ai
incorrectly
.
the
article
also
says
that
current
artificial
intelligence
has
improved
our
overall
livelihood
in
multiple
categories
.
i
agree
with
the
article
that
ai
has
greatly
improved
and
will
continue
to
improve
transportation
but
disagree
and
challenge
the
argument
that
ai
can
help
in
the
current
education
system
.
continuing
,
transportation
is
a
form
of
artificial
intelligence
that
i
ve
always
been
interested
in
.
let
me
elaborate
with
another
star
wars
reference
.
star
wars
has
ships
that
can
be
piloted
on
their
own
,
but
in
some
cases
droids
like
r2-d2
have
taken
over
and
flown
across
the
galaxy
.
who
would
ve
thought
watching
r2-d2
,
a
droid
imagined
in
the
late
1970s
,
would
actually
have
a
realistic
implication
in
the
transportation
world
today
?
i
remember
reading
about
google
s
goal
of
creating
a
self-driving
car
early
last
decade
,
and
now
many
manufacturers
,
such
as
tesla
,
have
accomplished
this
goal
.
although
tesla
s
don
t
have
r2-d2
controlling
your
car
,
the
car
can
self-drive
to
and
from
anywhere
,
and
even
unpark
itself
and
pick
you
up
at
a
storefront
.
automated
vehicles
are
now
a
reality
and
will
eventually
be
as
common
as
manually
controlled
vehicles
.
artificial
intelligence
has
its
place
in
the
world
,
but
there
are
situations
that
ai
can
put
people
at
a
disadvantage
?
i
disagree
with
the
article
s
beliefs
that
ai
can
help
in
the
education
system
.
to
begin
,
can
ai
physically
and
mentally
understand
a
student
s
struggles
,
or
attempt
to
find
the
best
learning
strategy
for
a
student
?
can
a
robot
even
adapt
to
a
student
or
the
whole
classroom
?
no
,
i
don
t
believe
so
.
every
student
has
their
own
unique
way
of
learning
,
some
learn
better
through
speech
,
others
through
videos
,
others
through
hands-on
learning
.
i
don
t
see
how
ai
can
adapt
to
all
of
these
strategies
in
a
typical
school
learning
environment
.
although
the
article
states
that
in
the
next
fifteen
years
,
it
is
likely
that
human
teachers
will
be
assisted
by
ai
technologies
with
better
human
interaction

report
-rrb-
,
i
don
t
see
how
ai
can
predict
a
student
s
specific
needs
.
does
ai
have
its
place
in
online
learning
?
yes
,
but
i
believe
the
best
way
for
a
student
to
learn
is
through
the
physical
connection
and
interaction
with
a
human
teacher
.
i
have
used
the
application
duolingo
to
reinforce
my
german
learning
,
but
i
wholeheartedly
believe
that
i
learned
better
through
my
teacher
than
i
did
through
duolingo
.
can
duolingo
be
a
secondary
device
to
learn
a
language
?
sure
,
but
without
the
help
of
human
interaction
i
don
t
believe
duolingo
can
be
successful
for
a
majority
of
students
.
all
in
all
,
ai
will
have
a
large
impact
on
our
future
s
,
but
i
believe
and
challenge
the
article
that
ai
should
not
have
a
place
in
the
current
educations
system
due
to
the
barrier
between
student
and
machine
.
