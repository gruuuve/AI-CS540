one
of
the
main
and
most
well
known
ai
technologies
being
explored
is
self
driving
cars
,
and
it
appears
that
they
are
on
the
verge
of
becoming
an
integral
part
of
our
society
.
they
offer
many
benefits
,
and
will
greatly
change
the
structure
of
transportation
,
but
the
assertion
made
by
the
100
year
ai
study
,
that
they
will
displace
the
need
for
public
transportation
,
seems
completely
false
.
it
also
suggests
``
public
transportation
may
change
form
towards
personal
rapid
transit
that
uses
small
capacity
vehicles
to
transport
people
''
,
which
again
,
is
not
the
direction
i
believe
to
be
realistic
in
transporting
an
increasing
urban
population
.
even
with
improved
routing
and
ability
to
synchronize
vehicles
to
improve
the
flow
of
traffic
,
cars
are
simply
too
large
and
inefficient
to
transport
a
large
amount
of
people
,
especially
given
the
layout
of
current
city
streets
.
in
the
same
amount
of
space
,
buses
or
rail
systems
can
transport
a
far
greater
amount
of
people
.
this
is
also
why
the
idea
of
using
even
smaller
capacity
vehicles
does
not
make
much
sense
.
self
driving
cars
will
certainly
be
able
to
reduce
car
congestion
in
cities
,
but
to
completely
remove
the
need
public
transport
would
require
a
large
increase
in
the
amount
of
cars
on
the
road
,
which
is
not
what
cities
need
and
the
environment
needs
.
they
do
offer
the
benefit
of
taking
people
directly
to
their
destinations
,
which
public
transit
does
not
,
but
a
well
built
out
system
would
still
greatly
minimize
walking
\/
secondary
transport
required
.
it
would
be
more
advantageous
to
utilize
ai
to
meld
a
variety
of
transit
forms
together
,
such
that
people
can
seamlessly
transfer
from
rail
to
bus
to
ride-share
as
all
of
them
have
their
own
niche
they
can
fill
out
.
another
important
aspect
to
consider
is
that
public
transport
is
more
accessible
and
one
of
the
only
ways
for
the
low
income
population
to
travel
,
and
removing
that
option
would
only
further
increase
wealth
disparity
.
it
seems
even
less
likely
that
we
will
have
solved
these
inequalities
by
the
time
self
driving
cars
are
rolled
out
,
and
as
these
driverless
cars
will
be
privately
operated
,
they
have
no
incentive
to
cater
to
these
lower
income
groups
either
.
