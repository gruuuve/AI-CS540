artificial
intelligence
in
the
world
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
is
the
development
of
computer
systems
that
are
designed
to
mimic
human
intelligence
.
an
important
way
that
ai
s
develop
decision
making
capabilities
is
by
learning
through
data
sets
such
as
with
machine
learning
,
supervised
learning
,
and
deep
learning
.
all
of
these
are
different
methods
of
training
an
ai
,
but
all
involve
an
input
of
data
to
learn
from
.
the
article
stated
the
ai
s
have
the
capability
of
decreasing
and
potentially
removing
human
bias
from
its
decision
making
-lrb-
stone
,
et
al
-rrb-
.
this
is
still
a
major
problem
,
especially
in
healthcare
,
that
is
easily
missed
and
overlooked
.
social
and\/or
economic
disparities
can
be
introduced
to
the
ai
through
a
reliance
on
data
derived
from
records
with
,
for
example
,
missing
data
,
different
sample
sizes
of
subgroups
,
and
misclassification
or
measurement
errors
.
not
all
these
are
obvious
to
the
developer
and
biases
may
then
be
unintentionally
learned
and
perpetuated
by
the
ai
.
looking
at
the
future
,
as
ais
continue
to
develop
,
it
is
predicted
that
their
thinking
capabilities
will
continue
to
evolve
and
become
more
similar
to
a
human
s.
as
this
comes
to
pass
,
ai
will
become
more
personalized
and
potentially
gain
the
ability
to
interact
with
humans
.
therefore
,
it
is
implied
that
ais
will
continue
to
learn
even
after
their
development
and
the
data
gained
during
the
interaction
and
learning
phase
could
also
introduce
human
bias
outside
of
the
developer
s
initial
design
.
assuming
that
a
developer
can
prevent
human
bias
from
being
taught
to
the
ai
during
the
initial
learning
phase
,
a
new
problem
arises
when
it
starts
to
learn
in
the
field
and
out
of
a
controlled
environment
.
because
of
this
,
putting
a
large
expectation
on
ais
being
impartial
could
also
potentially
lead
to
disappointment
from
consumers
and
delay
in
development
if
companies
and
the
government
can
not
rely
on
this
technology
.
to
help
prevent
this
,
this
problem
should
be
considered
in
more
detail
and
in
the
early
stages
of
the
ai
s
development
.
the
article
also
mentioned
its
predictions
on
the
development
and
use
of
ai
in
transportation
.
however
,
the
article
did
contradict
its
prediction
on
the
development
of
cars
in
the
near
future
by
saying
that
car
development
is
expected
to
increase
greatly
to
the
point
that
flying
cars
may
be
seen
as
well
and
that
it
is
also
unlikely
that
a
great
change
will
occur
over
the
next
decade

following
the
article
s
idea
that
transportation
development
has
the
potential
to
include
flying
cars
in
the
near
future
,
it
mentioned
that
new
policies
would
have
to
be
in
place
,
such
as
dictating
blame
in
the
case
of
accidents
or
crimes
,
safety
regulations
,
and
developer
regulations
,
but
one
point
that
it
didn
t
mention
was
the
potential
dangers
to
the
consumers
should
this
come
to
pass
.
it
s
not
just
the
development
of
the
cars
themselves
that
need
attention
,
but
also
vehicle
regulation
in
an
area
with
no
road
.
a
huge
change
to
traffic
laws
would
have
to
be
implemented
to
control
vehicles
that
can
willingly
change
elevation
.
another
problem
would
be
that
consumer
trust
would
be
slow
to
develop
if
the
use
of
airborne
vehicles
isn
t
easy
or
safe
to
use
.
designs
must
be
safe
to
use
by
all
kinds
of
people
,
like
those
who
are
less
tech
savvy
.
it
is
important
that
the
consequences
of
ai
implementation
are
thoroughly
thought
of
before
their
release
to
consumers
.
