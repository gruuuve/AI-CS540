in
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
''
,
the
study
panel
emphasizes
how
the
rapid
development
of
artificial
intelligence
has
attracted
many
researchers
'
attention
and
its
potential
value
in
various
fields
such
as
transportation
,
employment
and
entertainment
.
while
looking
forward
to
the
extensive
application
of
artificial
intelligence
which
could
bring
more
convenience
and
comfort
,
people
should
also
recognize
the
potential
risks
and
challenges
behind
the
beautiful
surface
.
in
terms
of
transportation
,
the
article
claims
that
an
increasing
number
of
self-driving
vehicles
are
expected
to
come
into
service
in
the
future
due
to
the
continual
upgrade
in
algorithm
and
recognition
techniques
which
makes
them
safer
on
the
road
but
the
risk
of
being
hacking
is
worrisome
.
admittedly
,
the
data
from
u.s.
department
of
transportation
(2018)
suggests
that
autonomous
cars
could
increase
safety
over
human
drivers
since
most
car
accidents
are
caused
by
human
error
such
as
getting
drunk
,
running
red
lights
and
texting
while
driving
.
besides
,
autonomous
vehicles
could
also
free-up
time
for
drivers
to
get
on
with
business
or
entertain
while
traveling
,
which
greatly
improves
human
comfort
and
efficiency
.
however
,
the
threat
of
hacking
is
one
major
obstacle
which
could
delay
or
even
halt
the
introduction
of
self-driving
vehicles
in
the
society
.
to
get
real-time
location
and
road
information
that
could
affect
driving
conditions
,
self-driving
vehicles
must
be
constantly
connected
to
the
internet
.
apparently
,
the
connectivity
would
be
vulnerable
to
all
sorts
of
hacker
attacks
.
according
to
the
report
by
greenberg
(2015)
,
in
2015
,
two
hackers
remotely
seized
the
control
of
a
jeep
on
the
highway
.
they
shut
off
the
transmission
and
disabled
the
jeep
's
brake
which
causes
it
to
rush
into
a
ditch
.
besides
,
more
reports
have
shown
that
autonomous
cars
can
be
attacked
by
hackers
wirelessly
from
anywhere
in
the
country
,
which
implies
that
self-driving
vehicles
with
internet
connection
functions
could
be
potential
targets
by
terrorists
.
therefore
,
without
dependable
regulatory
environment
and
cybersecurity
,
it
is
hard
to
formally
put
self-driving
vehicles
into
practical
use
for
the
moment
.
in
addition
,
according
to
the
article
,
though
the
combination
of
artificial
intelligence
and
education
would
benefit
students
at
large
,
it
is
still
difficult
to
be
widely
used
.
from
the
article
,
the
intelligent
tutoring
systems
-lrb-
its
-rrb-
can
function
without
human
operations
which
greatly
reduces
human
resources
.
the
machines
could
keep
working
continuously
and
are
able
to
answer
questions
accurately
at
any
time
.
moreover
,
teachers
can
obtain
the
students
'
learning
information
generated
by
the
system
and
provide
targeted
tutoring
.
on
the
contrary
,
several
drawbacks
have
slowed
down
the
introduction
of
ai
into
classroom
.
though
ai
could
save
time
for
teachers
and
enhance
a
student
's
learning
efficiency
,
its
high
cost
of
installation
and
maintenance
can
be
one
of
the
biggest
problems
.
without
adequate
subsidy
from
the
government
,
underfunded
school
can
hardly
benefit
from
it
.
in
addition
,
based
on
the
study
of
arkorful
,
valentina
,
and
nelly
abaidoo
(2015)
,
the
traditional
teaching
process
is
much
more
efficient
regarding
explanations
and
interpretations
since
a
good
teacher
could
find
other
easy-understanding
approaches
to
solves
problems
while
machine
holds
one
standard
solution
.
hence
,
face
to
face
tutoring
seems
to
be
relatively
more
efficient
and
affordable
in
general
.
to
conclude
,
the
introduction
and
application
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
society
is
inevitable
in
the
future
,
for
it
can
largely
improve
work
efficiency
as
well
as
reach
higher
accuracy
.
however
,
concerns
from
different
aspects
are
there
before
the
formal
introduction
of
ai
into
the
society
.
the
advent
of
ai
is
supposed
to
be
utilized
to
help
people
obtain
enhancement
on
work
efficiency
instead
of
replacing
human
resources
entirely
.
