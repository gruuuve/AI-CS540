artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
was
always
a
vague
term
to
me
.
whenever
i
think
of
ai
,
i
always
thought
of
a
perfect
butler
that
assists
people
aside
in
workplace
.
this
article
about
ai
and
life
in
2030
clearly
states
that
the
application
of
ai
in
the
workplace
greatly
changed
the
trend
of
the
workplace
.
the
change
of
workplace
demonstrates
enormous
potential
ai
possesses
,
however
,
i
still
believe
there
is
a
certain
limit
in
ai
technology
.
to
state
a
limit
in
ai
,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
there
is
a
part
in
human
that
ai
can
never
be
able
to
mimic
,
the
decision-making
.
also
,
the
decision-making
is
typically
crucial
in
employment
and
workplace
where
is
currently
getting
crept
by
automated
machines
.
the
article
mainly
argues
that
as
ai
technology
advances
in
the
future
,
ai
will
most
likely
dominate
human
workspace
by
creating
new
kinds
of
jobs
and
so
thereby
making
existing
jobs
obsolete
.
i
believe
that
it
is
somewhat
telling
the
truth
since
some
jobs
were
taken
by
newly
introduced
automated
machines
as
technology
advanced
in
the
history
.
constantly
improved
technology
might
replace
most
of
the
repetitive
jobs
in
the
future
.
however
,
i
doubt
that
the
implementation
of
ai
technology
still
has
some
limits
to
replace
all
the
human
jobs
such
as
lawyers
.
as
the
notion
of
ai
and
machine
learning
goes
,
ai
learns
from
precedent
records
or
events
and
implement
it
to
its
system
.
therefore
,
in
circumstances
where
precedents
do
not
exist
,
it
is
challenging
for
ai
to
make
better
decisions
than
that
of
humans
.
the
article
states
that
``
most
of
a
lawyer
's
job
is
not
yet
automated
''
but
i
doubt
that
it
will
ever
be
automated
.
even
though
ai
is
applied
to
the
automated
parts
of
first-year
lawyer
's
jobs
,
it
will
not
improve
to
be
a
more
sophisticated
part
of
lawyer
's
jobs
.
it
is
also
applied
to
a
doctor
's
job
where
doctors
make
a
decision
by
considering
many
physical
and
psychological
factors
of
a
patient
's
health
.
there
are
many
new
things
happens
in
the
medical
area
every
day
.
every
day
new
pathogens
,
new
unknown
diseases
are
discovered
from
many
various
patients
.
from
all
these
uncertain
factors
,
doctors
in
medical
fields
,
make
the
best
decision
they
can
make
and
apply
it
to
their
patients
.
these
kinds
of
decision
are
not
suitable
for
ai
.
ai
may
make
better
decisions
than
other
doctors
under
circumstances
where
there
are
plenty
of
data
and
precedent
cases
but
it
would
make
poor
decisions
or
even
not
be
able
to
make
one
where
there
are
not
much
data
for
it
.
i
think
that
ai
is
not
a
pioneer
but
rather
an
expert
who
makes
decisions
by
learning
from
precedent
things
that
former
human
pioneers
accomplished
.
therefore
,
i
think
it
is
best
for
ai
to
be
developed
in
a
way
to
assist
human
jobs
instead
of
built
up
to
replace
their
jobs
.
the
best
way
i
think
is
to
provide
adequate
information
to
humans
to
help
them
make
better
decisions
instead
of
making
the
decision
itself
.
with
this
way
,
i
believe
ai
can
make
a
much
greater
impact
on
employment
and
the
workplace
in
the
future
.
