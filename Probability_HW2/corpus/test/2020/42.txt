artificial
intelligence
has
the
potential
to
change
lives
in
nearly
any
industrial
.
we
are
constantly
finding
new
ways
to
implement
it
in
fields
such
as
medicine
,
robotics
,
language
processing
,
transportation
.
it
is
such
a
new
and
promising
technology
there
are
hundreds
of
new
applications
for
it
.
some
of
these
are
very
promising
and
others
may
take
years
to
come
to
fruition
.
in
the
article
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
the
author
makes
many
claims
about
the
future
and
predictions
in
artificial
intelligence
.
many
of
them
based
on
facts
and
general
trends
in
the
industry
.
many
of
these
claims
are
strong
and
have
evidence
supporting
them
however
,
i
'd
like
to
challenge
some
of
these
claims
,
specifically
the
claims
made
about
the
future
of
artificial
intelligence
in
transportation
.
to
begin
,
the
author
claims
that
self
driving
,
or
autonomous
cars
are
going
to
be
significantly
implemented
into
society
by
2020
.
well
it
's
2020
now
and
they
definitely
do
not
make
a
majority
of
the
cars
,
in
fact
there
is
still
a
very
small
percentage
of
autonomous
vehicles
.
these
vehicles
however
are
n't
even
fully
self
driving
they
can
only
assist
in
driving
and
there
are
still
many
advancements
that
need
to
be
made
in
their
capabilities
and
function
in
addition
to
laws
that
need
to
change
before
they
can
be
implemented
.
to
the
credit
of
the
author
this
article
is
a
few
years
old
but
it
still
seems
as
if
they
were
overly
optimistic
towards
the
ai
in
this
field
.
when
the
article
was
written
it
mentions
that
one
of
the
few
and
definitely
biggest
players
in
this
industry
is
tesla
,
and
now
in
2020
i
do
n't
think
much
has
changed
.
of
course
google
has
its
own
self
driving
vehicles
but
in
terms
of
consumer
facing
,
buyable
vehicles
,
you
'd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
anything
as
notable
as
a
tesla
.
the
author
then
goes
onto
mention
the
impact
autonomous
transportation
would
have
on
the
ride
sharing
business
.
they
state
that
it
would
greatly
improve
efficiency
and
allow
people
to
get
from
place
to
place
without
a
person
physically
in
the
car
driving
them
around
.
this
is
a
super
interesting
idea
for
the
future
of
transportation
but
just
like
the
last
point
believed
that
the
author
is
overly
optimistic
about
the
speed
at
which
this
innovation
can
be
achieved
.
before
any
of
this
can
be
done
we
must
first
be
able
to
have
completely
autonomous
vehicles
on
the
road
and
driving
.
technology
needs
to
be
improved
,
laws
changed
,
and
many
logistical
issues
figured
out
.
i
definitely
think
that
ai
will
play
a
big
part
in
our
lives
going
forward
and
transportation
especially
.
however
,
i
do
believe
the
author
needs
to
understand
that
it
will
take
more
time
.
even
with
such
a
powerful
too
the
technology
is
so
new
that
it
needs
to
be
worked
on
longer
before
it
can
be
better
understood
and
implemented
.
artificial
intelligence
will
change
the
world
but
it
needs
to
be
carefully
managed
and
planned
out
well
.
no
one
wants
half
working
ai
's
driving
them
to
work
everyday
.
