in
the
``
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
''
the
authors
describe
their
vision
for
the
role
of
ai
in
different
areas
in
2030
.
in
general
,
they
argue
that
large
advances
will
happen
in
the
next
few
years
in
a
variety
of
applications
of
ai
,
from
self-driving
cars
to
healthcare
.
the
authors
also
argue
that
the
most
important
considerations
for
defining
legal
policies
regarding
ai
are
to
ensure
that
government
officials
are
knowledgeable
about
it
,
remove
legal
barriers
to
research
,
and
fund
research
into
the
societal
impacts
of
ai
.
however
,
i
argue
that
the
authors
understate
the
difficulties
that
will
prevent
many
applications
of
ai
from
being
adopted
,
and
that
funding
for
all
types
of
ai
research
,
including
algorithms
,
applications
,
and
the
impact
of
those
applications
,
is
necessary
to
fully
take
advantage
of
the
technology
and
implement
its
applications
as
much
as
possible
.
one
of
the
predictions
that
the
authors
make
is
that
self-driving
cars
will
become
very
common
by
2030
.
they
argue
that
``
as
cars
will
become
better
drivers
than
people
,
city-dwellers
will
own
fewer
cars
,
live
further
from
work
,
and
spend
time
differently
,
leading
to
an
entirely
new
urban
organization
.
further
,
...
changes
wo
n't
be
limited
to
cars
and
trucks
,
but
are
likely
to
include
flying
vehicles
and
personal
robots
...
''
while
this
prediction
is
certainly
a
possibility
for
the
long-term
future
,
the
short
time
frame
that
the
authors
give
it
ignores
a
lot
of
the
difficulties
with
implementing
new
technologies
.
first
,
people
will
be
slow
to
adopt
self-driving
cars
because
they
do
not
trust
the
cars
and
do
not
want
to
give
up
their
own
control
.
convincing
people
to
give
up
their
own
autonomy
to
a
self-driving
machine
is
a
barrier
that
will
not
be
crossed
effortlessly
.
second
,
as
self-driving
cars
become
more
common
,
more
regulations
will
be
created
that
will
eventually
slow
down
and
change
their
production
.
companies
will
have
to
adapt
to
changing
laws
to
be
able
to
mass-produce
self-driving
cars
.
third
,
since
the
technology
for
self-driving
cars
is
new
and
developing
,
they
will
be
expensive
,
and
``
flying
vehicles
and
personal
robots
''
will
be
even
more
rare
and
expensive
.
high
costs
will
prohibit
a
lot
of
people
from
buying
autonomous
vehicles
,
which
will
slow
their
adoption
.
combined
,
these
three
factors
make
it
unlikely
that
self-driving
cars
will
fundamentally
change
transportation
by
2030
,
especially
not
to
the
point
at
which
urban
organization
would
change
.
