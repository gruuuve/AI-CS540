i
found
it
hard
to
find
points
to
challenge
in
this
report
.
much
of
it
i
agreed
with
.
how
society
is
taken
in
by
the
media
and
believe
that
ai
is
bad
and
could
rise
up
at
any
moment
.
the
first
sentence
that
that
seemed
off
was
how
this
report
said
something
close
to
a
human
like
artificial
intelligence
may
just
be
impossible
.
it
is
a
small
thing
and
only
said
once
,
but
great
things
have
been
made
that
were
once
thought
impossible
.
the
exact
quote
is
unlike
in
the
movies
,
there
is
no
race
of
superhuman
robots
on
the
horizon
or
probably
even
possible
.
while
the
report
does
use
the
words
probably
even
and
,
on
the
horizon
,
to
show
that
it
may
still
be
a
possibility
,
great
advances
in
science
have
happened
throughout
history
for
people
striving
for
the
impossible
.
after
this
the
report
goes
onto
defining
what
an
artificial
intelligence
is
.
the
definition
given
is
vague
,
but
that
seems
intentional
.
the
definition
pulled
from
the
report
is
nils
j.
nilsson
has
provided
a
useful
one
:
artificial
intelligence
is
that
activity
devoted
to
making
machines
intelligent
,
and
intelligence
is
that
quality
that
enables
an
entity
to
function
appropriately
and
with
foresight
in
its
environment
.
while
this
definition
does
a
good
job
defining
intelligence
and
more
specifically
artificial
intelligence
,
the
word
appropriately
is
up
for
interpretation
.
it
is
noticed
that
the
report
does
not
call
this
definition
the
true
definition
of
ai
rather
a
useful
one
.
still
though
the
word
appropriately
is
said
,
and
while
one
person
may
think
it
appropriate
to
do
one
thing
another
might
think
it
unusual
.
this
could
show
up
in
education
,
what
may
be
considered
appropriate
for
someone
to
learn
?
it
then
refers
to
the
many
domains
that
ai
is
and
can
be
present
in
.
there
are
no
points
to
really
challenge
amongst
this
as
it
mostly
just
presents
factual
information
.
the
2030
predictions
is
the
only
thing
will
more
than
likely
get
delayed
.
ai
in
transportation
will
more
than
likely
be
one
of
the
first
biggest
uses
of
ai
that
most
of
society
will
be
exposed
to
.
the
report
mentions
that
owning
a
vehicle
might
become
obsolete
which
for
the
most
part
could
definitely
be
a
thing
.
though
,
and
obviously
statistical
anomalies
usually
always
exist
,
many
secluded
people
far
away
from
a
requestable
vehicle
would
still
own
a
vehicle
themselves
.
the
rest
seem
they
would
have
a
take
of
in
acceptance
by
common
society
eventually
and
exist
presently
in
many
communities
.
not
all
implementation
of
these
ai
may
be
obvious
to
some
,
but
they
do
exist
.
they
policy
reference
in
this
report
seems
rather
on
point
.
throughout
the
report
it
was
mentioned
that
equality
is
needed
and
that
it
could
be
a
challenge
.
this
would
seem
to
be
widely
agreed
as
no
one
would
want
to
be
treated
differently
because
of
some
uniqueness
to
the
individual
or
group
of
individuals
.
while
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
,
everyone
should
be
able
to
access
the
technology
of
ai
to
help
everyone
have
the
best
chance
they
can
to
be
the
best
they
can
.
overall
it
is
hard
to
find
points
to
challenge
on
a
report
that
i
felt
very
agreeable
with
