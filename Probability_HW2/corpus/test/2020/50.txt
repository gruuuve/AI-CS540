the
study
panel
's
perspective
on
how
ai
can
support
legal
work
is
unclear
,
and
may
be
too
optimistic
.
in
the
section
regarding
ai
policy
,
there
exists
a
slight
contradiction
that
does
not
have
a
clear
resolution
,
at
least
within
this
article
.
the
study
panel
mentions
the
potential
biases
that
may
naturally
exist
as
a
result
of
humans
choosing
the
data
sets
with
which
ai
will
be
trained
on
.
essentially
,
the
decisions
that
result
from
an
amalgamation
of
data
can
carry
with
them
many
of
the
same
mistakes
,
and
similar
issues
can
arise
.
after
acknowledging
this
,
however
,
the
panel
proceeds
to
mention
that
ai
has
the
potential
to
make
comparatively
more
objective
decisions
than
humans
in
situations
such
as
court
cases
.
although
the
scope
of
this
article
is
intentionally
cursory
in
several
sections
,
the
particular
topic
of
ai
's
decision
making
potential
could
use
more
elaboration
.
if
the
study
panel
's
intended
reasoning
behind
this
phrasing
is
that
ai
would
be
able
to
easily
search
through
similar
cases
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
verdict
,
one
could
counter
this
by
arguing
that
the
outcomes
of
those
previous
cases
represent
a
dataset
riddled
with
human
bias
.
if
the
ai
is
somehow
trained
to
recognize
this
bias
in
particular
,
this
approach
might
improve
our
justice
system
.
yet
,
there
exists
inherent
flaws
in
how
we
define
a
just
conclusion
to
a
problem
.
without
an
objective
way
to
determine
how
justice
is
represented
,
bias
will
hardly
be
minimized
.
this
especially
holds
true
for
legal
work
,
given
the
assumption
that
humans
and
ai
will
work
in
tandem
and
that
humans
will
still
be
responsible
for
the
final
decision
.
it
is
possible
that
ai
will
only
serve
to
hasten
the
work
that
people
normally
do
unaided
rather
than
improve
its
total
quality
.
under
the
same
section
,
the
study
panel
mentions
how
the
advent
of
ai
technology
capable
of
performing
tasks
usually
designated
for
humans
will
result
in
a
reduction
of
those
skills
for
the
general
population
.
as
we
develop
a
reliance
on
ai
,
says
the
panel
,
we
will
gradually
forget
trades
and
skills
that
were
once
commonplace
.
the
example
that
the
article
provides
is
that
calculators
have
reduced
the
need
for
children
to
excel
at
mental
arithmetic
,
which
is
a
highly
convincing
analogy
to
how
ai
could
affect
other
aspects
of
our
lives
.
while
the
panel
posits
that
this
loss
of
skill
can
be
offset
by
a
focus
on
a
skillset
that
is
more
fundamentally
human
,
it
does
not
do
enough
to
assuage
the
concerns
that
people
have
on
this
subject
.
contrary
to
the
article
,
ai
diminishing
some
skills
is
not
an
inherently
negative
turn
of
events
.
as
the
panel
mentions
in
other
sections
,
the
loss
of
jobs
can
be
countered
by
the
creation
of
new
ones
that
arise
from
unforeseen
demands
.
depending
on
the
degree
that
ai
fundamentally
changes
how
work
is
done
,
the
elimination
of
many
jobs
would
eventually
resolve
itself
with
political
changes
.
as
technology
continually
develops
,
old
skills
will
inevitably
become
obsolete
.
as
this
occurs
,
we
can
depend
on
a
strong
mutualistic
relationship
with
ai
.
