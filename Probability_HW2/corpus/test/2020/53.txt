artificial
intelligence
is
becoming
more
and
more
pervasive
throughout
society
,
transforming
many
aspects
of
everyone
's
day
to
day
lives
whether
they
are
aware
of
it
or
not
.
it
is
important
to
study
and
analyze
the
potential
impacts
that
this
technology
might
have
.
the
100
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
,
a
report
from
stanford
written
in
2016
,
outlines
a
general
idea
of
what
artificial
intelligence
is
and
some
of
the
possible
effects
of
the
integration
of
this
new
technology
into
certain
sectors
of
society
.
one
of
the
sectors
discussed
is
transportation
,
in
which
the
authors
of
the
report
assume
an
idealistic
view
of
how
artificial
intelligence
might
affect
this
part
of
society
.
while
artificial
intelligence
will
definitely
play
a
role
in
shaping
transportation
in
the
future
,
it
will
not
have
as
large
an
impact
as
the
authors
of
the
report
believe
,
at
least
within
the
next
ten
years
,
due
to
issues
of
feasibility
and
affordability
.
the
initial
statement
the
authors
make
about
the
impact
of
artificial
intelligence
on
transportation
is
that
``
autonomous
transportation
will
soon
be
commonplace
''
and
that
a
typical
city
in
2030
will
have
``
flying
vehicles
''

.
there
are
a
lot
of
legal
and
logistical
implications
of
personal
flying
vehicles
such
as
large
human-sized
drones
,
or
even
flying
cars
,
that
make
those
statements
an
almost
impossible
reality
.
bureaucracy
is
slow
;
a
small
amount
of
autonomous
vehicles
have
been
on
the
road
for
years
,
yet
questions
like
whose
responsibility
is
it
if
someone
is
hit
with
an
autonomous
vehicle
remain
ambiguous
in
the
law
.
it
is
doubtful
the
government
would
allow
a
large
amount
of
these
types
of
vehicles
to
appear
on
roadways
until
these
issues
are
clarified
.
another
issue
with
the
adoption
of
flying
vehicles
is
determining
where
they
would
be
able
to
fly
.
in
addition
to
the
feasibility
of
having
a
large
amount
of
autonomous
cars
on
the
road
,
there
is
also
the
issue
of
how
many
people
would
actually
own
a
self-driving
vehicle
.
currently
,
cars
that
have
self-driving
capabilities
like
teslas
are
some
of
the
more
expensive
cars
on
the
market
.
the
majority
of
middle-class
and
lower-class
people
will
not
be
able
to
afford
these
types
of
cars
,
questioning
what
the
actual
prevalence
of
autonomous
vehicles
in
2030
will
be
.
many
people
who
can
not
afford
cars
also
rely
heavily
on
public
transportation
.
in
the
report
,
the
authors
mention
that
self-driving
cars
could
potentially
replace
the
need
for
public
transportation
.
however
,
this
again
raises
questions
of
affordability
.
services
like
uber
or
lyft
charge
a
premium
price
,
certainly
more
than
the
price
of
a
bus
or
subway
fare
.
the
integration
of
self-driving
cars
into
public
transportation
could
negatively
affect
the
people
who
can
not
afford
these
services
.
the
authors
make
ambitious
assumptions
of
the
speed
of
adoption
and
the
feasibility
of
autonomous
vehicles
.
while
there
are
many
potential
benefits
of
artificial
intelligence
within
transportation
,
it
is
unrealistic
to
assume
that
this
aspect
of
society
will
be
significantly
impacted
within
the
next
ten
years
.
in
other
sectors
,
however
,
artificial
intelligence
is
making
a
rapid
impact
,
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
effects
it
will
have
in
the
future
.
