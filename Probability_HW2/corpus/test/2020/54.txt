acts
before
implementation
of
ai
technology
has
driven
humanity
forward
and
simultaneously
required
us
to
understand
its
essence
and
potential
.
the
act
of
understanding
does
not
limit
to
its
technicality
but
includes
its
ethical
usage
.
the
article
suggests
ways
to
embed
artificial
intelligence
into
current
society
.
although
the
article
explains
from
a
perspective
within
the
knowledge
of
the
benefits
of
ai
,
it
seems
to
overlook
the
negative
aspects
.
the
article
says
,
``
rather
than
more
or
stricter
regulation
,
policies
should
be
designed
to
encourage
helpful
innovation
...
''
,
but
to
avoid
a
possible
disaster
caused
by
ai
,
it
is
important
to
take
development
more
cautiously
because
the
impact
of
this
new
technology
on
us
is
much
more
impactful
than
it
ever
was
in
the
past
.
the
problem
with
newer
ai
is
that
we
can
not
pinpoint
the
causation
of
the
problem
from
its
implementation
in
the
midst
of
ambiguous
representation
;
we
did
not
fully
establish
countermeasures
of
unethical
usage
of
the
technology
.
thus
,
the
implementation
of
the
ai
technology
in
our
daily
interaction
needs
to
occur
within
clear
and
cautious
steps
of
integration
.
in
other
words
,
under
the
strict
and
false
proof
policy
.
recent
ai
technology
includes
much
more
data
compared
to
the
past
due
to
the
rise
of
cloud
computing
,
and
it
is
susceptible
to
losing
the
meaning
of
data
due
to
the
flooding
data
,
possibly
returning
false
implementation
.
the
idea
of
deep
learning
,
for
example
,
is
pretty
much
,
``
if
it
works
then
it
's
fine
''
.
even
the
very
basic
implementation
of
deep
learning
,
where
the
computer
predicts
a
number
when
given
an
image
of
the
number
,
it
is
difficult
to
explain
each
layer
of
the
model
into
human
sensible
words
.
this
means
the
ambiguity
in
inner
implementation
due
to
the
difference
in
computer
perception
compared
to
human
perception
exists
,
in
other
words
meaning
,
there
is
a
reliance
on
the
technology
with
an
uncertain
understanding
of
the
mechanics
of
the
inner
process
.
the
shortcomings
of
the
technology
will
be
critical
once
it
fails
.
the
ambiguity
in
implementation
can
possibly
cause
harm
to
society
due
to
our
heavy
reliance
on
technology
,
especially
when
we
comfort
ourselves
regardless
of
its
ambiguity
in
implementation
.
making
matters
worse
,
once
the
ai
technology
is
used
for
an
unethical
purpose
,
it
can
bring
disaster
that
humanity
is
never
prepared
for
.
similar
to
ai
technology
,
the
nuclear
bomb
was
a
new
technology
that
humanity
in
the
past
had
not
achieved
to
realization
.
after
hiroshima
,
the
effects
of
the
atomic
bomb
still
remain
.
although
the
negative
impact
is
difficult
to
imagine
,
one
can
not
agree
to
a
blind
assertion
that
ai
will
bring
no
harm
to
humanity
.
it
may
not
be
like
a
sci-fi
movie
where
ai
takes
over
the
world
,
but
it
is
reasonable
to
consider
hackers
that
use
ai
for
a
wrong
purpose
,
such
as
implementing
machine
learning
to
decoding
encryption
in
the
finance
market
and
worse
.
in
addition
,
the
implementation
of
ai
can
deepen
the
gap
of
inequality
in
our
society
where
the
rich
get
richer
and
the
poor
get
poorer
by
predefining
and
pre-orienting
the
set
of
data
for
ai
.
it
is
not
to
say
that
we
should
stop
the
development
or
study
of
ai
.
it
is
actually
the
opposite
,
which
is
to
educate
people
about
ai
and
seek
its
implementation
in
the
world
but
under
the
condition
where
we
are
aware
of
the
need
for
strict
regulation
.
regulation
keeps
us
safe
from
new
technology
,
brings
smooth
integration
with
it
,
and
leads
to
its
right
implementation
.
until
a
safety
net
exists
,
the
careless
implementation
of
ai
should
be
considered
.
