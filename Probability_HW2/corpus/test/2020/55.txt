the
ai100
report
includes
a
rich
variety
of
information
regarding
ai
in
its
current
state
and
what
it
could
look
like
in
the
future
.
it
also
provides
some
advice
and
considerations
regarding
struggles
that
ai
could
face
,
including
its
public
perception
and
some
nefarious
tasks
for
which
it
could
unfortunately
be
used
.
however
,
while
they
do
mention
these
considerations
,
there
are
at
least
a
couple
issues
discussed
that
could
use
more
stern
instruction
on
how
to
move
forward
.
on
page
38
of
the
paper
,
the
enlarged
text
reads
,
ai
will
likely
replace
tasks
rather
than
jobs
in
the
near
term
,
and
will
also
create
new
kinds
of
jobs
.
but
the
new
jobs
that
will
emerge
are
harder
to
imagine
in
advance
than
the
existing
jobs
that
will
likely
be
lost
.
with
this
sentiment
,
the
authors
of
the
report
might
not
be
considering
that
the
tasks
being
replaced
could
certainly
lead
to
the
overall
job
being
replaced
,
especially
in
the
case
of
low-skilled
positions
that
typically
involve
a
small
number
of
repetitive
tasks
.
it
would
be
unwise
to
not
ponder
the
implications
of
tasks
-lrb-
and
eventually
jobs
themselves
-rrb-
being
replaced
by
automation
.
those
who
would
lose
their
careers
due
to
automation
might
not
have
the
experience
needed
to
obtain
employment
in
the
new
type
of
work
that
the
article
alleges
.
this
is
because
these
new
positions
would
likely
require
higher-skilled
work
,
or
potentially
a
new
type
of
skill
not
necessary
for
the
previously
replaced
job
.
the
report
notes
that
actions
will
need
to
take
place
to
compensate
for
this
potentially
devastating
loss
of
jobs
and
,
subsequently
,
the
livelihood
of
the
replaced
workers
.
it
states
,
in
the
short
run
,
education
,
re-training
,
and
inventing
new
goods
and
services
may
mitigate
these
effects
.
longer
term
,
the
current
social
safety
net
may
need
to
evolve
into
better
social
services
for
everyone
,
such
as
healthcare
and
education
,
or
a
guaranteed
basic
income
.
while
these
are
sensible
recommendations
,
it
might
be
wise
to
consider
enacting
a
moratorium
on
ai
replacing
careers
.
this
would
be
in
place
until
specific
policies
are
decided
regarding
how
to
perform
a
just
transition
for
the
workers
who
would
possibly
lose
their
livelihoods
.
the
potential
benefits
of
ai
in
the
workplace
could
be
astounding
and
could
mean
that
future
generations
will
achieve
a
higher
standard
of
living
,
with
typically
backbreaking
or
repetitive
work
being
off
the
table
.
for
this
potential
benefit
to
become
a
reality
,
however
,
those
in
power
need
to
very
seriously
consider
what
needs
to
be
done
to
prepare
for
a
large
shift
in
many
industries
of
work
,
most
immediately
in
the
factory
setting
.
another
issue
on
which
the
report
could
potentially
elaborate
more
is
that
of
the
potential
biases
that
could
muddy
the
implementation
and
fairness
of
the
algorithms
in
ai
.
the
report
reads
,
further
,
ai
applications
and
the
data
they
rely
upon
may
reflect
the
biases
of
their
designers
and
users
,
who
specify
the
data
sources
.
it
could
be
recommended
that
the
report
elaborate
a
bit
more
on
how
ai
could
be
implemented
in
a
way
that
minimizes
bias
.
overall
,
this
is
a
well-written
report
that
is
rich
with
information
and
wise
considerations
of
potential
difficulties
that
ai
could
face
,
as
well
as
the
possible
benefits
for
society
that
it
could
confer
.
while
they
do
mention
potential
difficulties
,
however
,
they
could
in
general
be
a
bit
more
urgent
in
these
concerns
.
some
of
the
issues
discussed
require
action
as
quickly
as
possible
at
the
policy
level
,
such
as
preparing
for
the
loss
of
jobs
for
those
in
low-skilled
work
via
automation
.
