the
effects
of
ai
on
jobs
with
the
rapid
development
of
ai
in
various
fields
,
there
has
some
concern
about
how
it
will
affect
.
in
the
``
stanford
2016
report
''
,
it
says
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
be
anxious
about
immediate
danger
for
upcoming
30
years
as
there
is
no
possible
long-term
self-sustaining
machine
that
has
been
developed
,
nor
in
the
future
.
although
,
they
claim
that
the
progress
made
by
ai
makes
our
life
much
better
and
easier
to
live
,
they
often
underestimate
the
underlying
risks
it
could
engender
.
instead
,
it
actually
poses
a
potential
threat
to
people
's
safety
and
their
jobs
.
even
though
replacing
humans
with
robots
could
cause
a
myriad
of
people
to
lose
jobs
,
the
reports
state
that
this
might
still
make
working
place
much
more
safe
.
for
example
,
drones
would
be
far
faster
than
humans
to
take
products
on
a
dangerous
site
and
using
robotic
arms
in
surgery
provides
stability
in
surgery
procedure
.
it
maintains
that
the
use
and
expansion
of
ai
application
certainly
give
more
trust
and
stability
in
people
's
overall
workspace
.
however
,
the
effects
can
be
both
positive
and
negative
,
and
it
seems
that
the
overall
net
effect
is
uncertain
.
despite
the
fact
that
ai
might
enhance
labor
's
work
environment
,
this
influence
is
brief
and
unsustainable
.
tegmark
(2016)
states
that
because
ai
is
designed
to
accomplish
human
's
desire
,
it
will
do
anything
to
achieve
its
goal
and
could
have
devastating
result
.
this
shows
that
if
people
only
want
immediate
benefits
on
safety
and
overestimate
its
potential
threat
on
their
employment
,
it
might
cost
numerous
casualties
later
.
therefore
,
it
is
uncertain
that
whether
replacing
other
jobs
with
ai
could
be
safe
for
people
's
daily
life
.
furthermore
,
ai
gives
potential
intimidation
to
people
for
losing
their
jobs
because
of
its
numerous
application
to
different
areas
.
it
could
relatively
regard
other
jobs
as
obsolete
,
which
makes
many
of
low
skilled
labors
be
on
the
edge
of
losing
their
jobs
.
brookings
reports
that
the
number
of
jobs
that
do
not
need
more
than
basic
digital
skills
has
fallen
from
56
to
30
percent
between
2002
to
2012

so
these
low
skilled
workers
who
are
only
used
to
doing
simple
repetitive
labors
are
now
required
to
learn
other
technologies
beyond
their
capability
.
therefore
,
it
could
be
hard
for
low
skilled
laborers
to
learn
technologies
that
require
more
complicated
and
detailed
works
and
get
a
job
for
that
.
not
only
low
skilled
laborers
are
stuck
in
the
mire
with
the
menace
of
ai
,
but
also
high
skilled
labors
are
under
threat
to
be
unemployed
.
what
might
be
a
problem
is
that
the
standard
of
``
low
skilled
''
labor
has
been
higher
as
time
goes
by
.
recently
,
service
robots
are
starting
to
replace
highly
trained
experts
as
well
as
the
industrial
robots
that
serve
nasty
and
perilous
work
.
wasen
(2010)
also
states
that
because
robots
make
less
mistake
than
human
surgical
assistants
,
once
they
are
programmed
,
most
of
surgeons
are
more
than
willing
to
accept
these
robot
assistants
as
their
partner
.
as
surgeons
belong
to
one
of
high-skilled
sectors
,
this
shift
implies
how
easy
for
the
robots
to
replace
specialists
who
spend
large
amount
of
time
becoming
a
specialist
in
that
area
.
ai
entails
an
actual
threat
to
people
's
lives
with
potential
risk
in
their
current
jobs
.
no
matter
how
much
it
enriches
people
's
quality
of
life
,
it
could
make
numerous
people
unable
to
work
and
be
isolated
from
others
.
although
preparation
of
advent
of
ai
,
by
carefully
limiting
how
much
we
allow
them
to
take
over
us
,
should
be
needed
rather
than
excessive
use
and
development
of
ai
.
