the
first
report
from
the
one
hundred
year
study
was
a
sweeping
analysis
of
the
future
of
ai
,
and
its
applications
.
in
reading
the
report
,
the
application
of
ai
technology
to
law
enforcement
was
the
most
troubling
,
and
seemed
to
gloss
over
several
potential
technical
pitfalls
.
at
the
heart
of
the
u.s
justice
system
sits
a
principle
of
innocence
until
guilt
is
proven
.
most
implementations
of
ai
and
even
enhanced
surveillance
turns
that
into
a
predictive
guilt
,
waiting
on
proof
of
innocence
.
the
discussion
in
the
review
touched
on
some
existing
issues
with
predictive
policing
,
such
as
compstat
.
however
,
the
report
struck
the
general
tone
that
ai
implementation
could
greatly
benefit
public
safety
through
more
``
targeted
''
deployment
of
law
enforcement
.
the
writers
``
assume
careful
deployment
''
,
but
even
if
an
ai
implementation
is
extremely
effective
at
identifying
potential
criminals
or
crime
,
we
begin
to
lose
due
process
.
let
's
say
that
we
have
a
great
predictive
policing
tool
that
uses
surveillance
to
identify
criminal
hotspots
-
by
nature
,
law
enforcement
will
always
involve
human
error
and
the
result
of
presumed
ai
infallibility
coupled
with
human
biases
could
be
devastating
.
law
enforcement
might
start
using
ai
results
as
a
means
of
acquiring
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
behavior
and
use
that
to
detain
a
``
suspect
''
.
recently
,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
struck
down
the
use
of
traffic
cameras
for
issuing
violations
because
it
deprived
the
accused
of
their
legal
right
to
due
process
.
i
believe
that
any
major
implementation
of
predictive
algorithms
in
policing
are
set
society
on
a
very
slippery
,
orwellian
slope
.
there
are
also
concerns
about
reinforcing
existing
societal
biases
with
an
ai
implementation
.
generally
,
ai
requires
a
training
set
and
a
test
set
to
begin
deployment
.
there
are
several
significant
roadblocks
to
a
successful
deployment
that
were
not
mentioned
in
the
report
.
first
,
how
would
one
``
predict
''
the
location
of
a
future
criminal
act
?
the
training
set
could
consist
of
police
reports
by
block
or
neighborhood
,
but
that
set
has
a
bias
against
the
same
neighborhoods
that
already
experience
an
overbearing
police
presence
.
it
could
draw
from
911
or
emergency
calls
,
but
some
neighborhoods
and
cultures
are
far
less
likely
to
report
crimes
.
as
soon
as
physical
location
systematically
determines
how
likely
the
police
are
to
consider
a
potential
suspect
for
a
future
crime
,
our
legal
right
to
due
process
and
moral
desire
for
freedom
will
be
in
tatters
.
this
is
already
a
problem
,
but
one
we
need
to
solve
,
not
exacerbate
.
there
are
some
very
positive
trends
in
u.s
policing
,
which
we
should
develop
further
before
going
down
another
rabbit
hole
.
community
policing
,
the
practice
of
reaching
out
to
traditionally
``
high-crime
''
neighborhoods
to
develop
a
positive
working
relationship
with
the
public
has
been
encouraging
.
law
enforcement
taking
the
time
to
build
trust
in
the
community
has
,
and
will
continue
to
reap
benefits
for
safety
.
these
approaches
have
been
shown
to
work
very
well
in
countries
like
germany
and
sweden
.
