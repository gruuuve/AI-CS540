in
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
experts
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
attempt
to
consider
the
likely
influences
of
ai
in
a
typical
north
american
city
by
the
year
2030
-lrb-
1
-rrb-
.
the
panel
of
experts
explore
the
impact
of
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
on
a
broad
range
of
domains
,
from
transportation
to
education
.
while
i
agree
with
many
of
the
assertions
made
,
i
challenge
some
points
made
by
the
authors
on
the
basis
of
introduced
bias
.
more
specifically
,
i
believe
that
the
statements
made
about
societal
fear
of
ai
and
the
military
application
of
ai
are
incorrect
due
to
the
authors
positive
biases
towards
ai
.
because
the
panel
that
wrote
this
paper
consists
of
ai
experts
,
their
assertions
about
the
``
correct
''
path
for
ai
research
tends
to
skew
toward
the
advancement
of
ai
above
all
else
.
for
instance
,
the
panel
describes
societal
fears
towards
ai
as
missteps
that
slow
ai
s
development
-lrb-

-rrb-
.
they
then
continue
on
to
say
that
ai
has
the
potential
to
make
driving
safer
,
help
children
learn
,
and
extend
and
enhance
people
s
lives
-lrb-

-rrb-
.
while
i
agree
that
ai
has
the
potential
to
vastly
improve
life
,
i
also
believe
that
societal
skepticism
towards
ai
should
not
be
written
off
as
a
misstep
.
the
panel
seems
to
believe
that
prioritizing
ai
advancement
will
result
in
ai
technology
which
will
be
impressive
enough
to
alleviate
public
concern
alone
.
i
believe
that
societal
concerns
towards
ai
should
be
alleviated
with
funding
towards
education
about
what
ai
actually
is
and
how
it
operates
.
educating
the
public
,
instead
of
ignoring
their
concerns
,
would
help
society
improve
their
knowledge
of
ai
while
ai
is
also
improving
,
allowing
voters
and
lawmakers
to
make
appropriate
decisions
based
on
knowledge
of
real
ai
technology
,
not
fear
.
another
clear
case
of
the
panels
bias
is
present
in
its
decision
to
ignore
the
military
applications
of
ai
-lrb-
deemed
outside
the
scope
of
their
report
-rrb-
.
if
a
panel
is
formed
to
inform
about
the
potential
life
changing
applications
of
ai
in
the
next
10
years
,
the
use
of
ai
in
the
military
simply
can
not
be
ignored
.
while
the
subject
itself
may
be
hard
to
talk
about
,
ai
has
already
made
a
huge
impact
in
warfare
.
in
fact
,
a
2017
news
article
reports
that
russia
has
already
developed
a
missile
which
is
capable
of
making
its
own
decisions
based
on
various
sensors
and
incorporates
some
sort
of
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
2
-rrb-
.
even
the
panel
itself
recognizes
that
automated
perception
...
is
already
near
or
at
human-level
performance
for
well-defined
tasks
such
as
recognition
and
tracking
-lrb-

-rrb-
.
it
would
be
naive
to
think
that
this
technology
will
not
be
used
for
military
applications
,
leading
to
a
real
and
noticeable
impact
on
life
in
2030
.
military
application
of
ai
,
in
my
opinion
,
should
be
recognized
as
having
the
potential
to
change
life
as
we
know
it
,
and
certainly
should
be
included
in
a
study
of
ai
such
as
the
paper
presented
.
in
conclusion
,
while
i
agree
with
most
observations
made
in
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
i
also
believe
that
the
report
is
somewhat
biased
with
the
views
of
the
authors
.
while
they
recognize
the
most
practical
applications
of
ai
,
they
fail
to
properly
evaluate
public
opinion
of
ai
and
fail
to
recognize
its
potentially
life
changing
impact
in
the
military
.
