i
believe
that
the
authors
of
this
paper
,
the
standing
committee
that
checks
over
the
one
hundred
year
study
,
are
doing
a
very
good
job
by
analyzing
all
of
this
info
and
trying
to
inform
the
public
of
the
current
state
of
ai
.
with
the
ambiguity
behind
the
term
and
the
fantasies
that
hollywood
puts
into
our
brain
,
many
people
have
trouble
understanding
what
ai
even
is
,
and
this
trouble
of
understanding
extends
to
even
college
students
that
are
taking
this
course
.
this
study
did
a
great
job
at
laying
out
the
different
elements
for
me
to
take
in
one
by
one
,
and
slowly
come
to
understand
all
the
use
applications
of
``
artificial
intelligence
''
and
how
many
different
types
of
technologies
can
be
classified
under
it
.
while
the
study
report
was
fantastic
in
many
eyes
,
there
were
a
couple
points
that
i
wanted
to
challenge
in
the
study
,
as
i
believed
them
to
be
wrong
or
misguided
.
the
study
goes
very
into
depth
on
the
problems
that
ai
could
present
society
,
due
it
's
ability
to
massively
generate
wealth
and
the
fact
that
advanced
ai
technologies
may
be
unfairly
distributed
,
so
that
wealth
will
be
undistributed
as
well
.
the
study
details
a
few
different
steps
that
the
world
can
take
to
help
address
specific
concerns
over
the
implications
of
society
the
evolving
ai
technologies
will
have
.
the
first
of
these
is
to
``
define
a
path
toward
accuring
technical
expertise
in
ai
at
all
levels
of
government
.
''
the
next
part
of
it
talks
about
how
if
we
are
to
govern
correctly
over
ai
,
the
government
is
going
to
need
actual
experts
that
are
able
to
understand
the
various
interactions
between
ai
's
and
humans
.
