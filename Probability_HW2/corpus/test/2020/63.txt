artificial
intelligence
will
not
spread
to
education
as
fast
as
this
report
suggests
,
especially
in
lower
income
areas
where
classrooms
do
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
afford
machine
tutors
.
when
schools
enact
new
policy
,
they
are
usually
looking
to
increase
their
own
standing
among
other
schools
in
the
area
and
nationwide
.
schools
commonly
choose
to
further
their
standing
in
the
construction
of
new
sports
facilities
or
perhaps
refurbishing
an
auditorium
.
new
spending
on
experimental
technology
and
practices
introduced
.
such
programs
are
usually
executed
in
large
expensive
waves
,
such
as
purchasing
laptops
or
chromebooks
for
students
all
at
once
.
a
notable
exception
to
this
trend
has
been
the
advent
of
standardized
testing
in
k12
programs
all
over
the
united
states
in
the
last
decade
or
so
.
however
,
schools
were
heavily
incentivised
to
perform
well
in
these
tests
as
schools
that
post
high
test
scores
typically
recieve
more
public
funding
.
while
the
overall
effectiveness
of
such
policies
are
debatable
at
best
,
but
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
incentive
programs
would
have
to
be
put
in
place
before
we
will
see
widespread
adoption
of
ai
tutors
in
schools
when
schools
tend
to
be
strapped
for
funding
as
is
.
another
reason
that
schools
will
likely
remain
slow
to
adopt
artificial
intelligence
in
the
learning
environment
is
the
cost
of
such
an
operation
.
as
of
now
,
the
cost
of
creating
a
machine
tutor
that
is
general
enough
to
work
in
multiple
subjects
and
cheap
enough
to
be
widely
adoptable
for
even
low
income
school
districts
is
simply
far
too
high
to
consider
for
most
school
districts
.
sure
schools
may
adopt
services
like
duolingo
for
a
few
foreign
language
students
,
but
as
a
whole
,
ai
will
only
make
a
large
impact
in
the
services
that
schools
already
use
.
for
example
,
if
ai
could
provide
a
better
analysis
of
the
data
gathered
from
standardized
tests
,
then
schools
will
have
an
incentive
to
begin
utilizing
ai
.
at
first
this
sounds
like
exactly
the
kind
of
integration
into
schools
the
report
is
alledging
,
however
this
is
not
the
case
.
school
administrators
,
teachers
,
and
most
importantly
students
,
will
not
directly
see
the
benefits
of
ai
unitl
ai
agents
are
actively
analyzing
students
'
schoolwork
as
they
complete
it
in
all
aspects
of
learning
.
simply
an
increase
in
ai
in
some
of
the
tools
that
some
schools
use
is
not
a
significant
rise
in
ai
use
in
education
.
in
conclusion
,
i
have
argued
that
while
some
of
the
tools
that
schools
currently
may
be
further
enhanced
by
artificial
intelligence
,
i
disagree
in
that
there
will
not
be
a
large
surge
in
ai
in
the
classroom
in
an
easily
identifiable
way
before
2030
.
this
is
due
to
both
schools
lacking
financial
incentives
to
adopt
such
technologies
,
and
the
sheer
cost
of
such
a
project
.
while
in
the
future
such
tools
as
duolingo
,
and
sherlock
may
increasingly
use
ai
,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
true
ai
tutor
will
come
about
before
the
year
2030
.
in
other
words
,
i
do
not
predict
that
ai
will
be
adopted
at
the
rapid
pace
anticipated
by
the
100
year
