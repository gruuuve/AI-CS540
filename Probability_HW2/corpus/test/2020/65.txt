it
is
highly
debatable
as
to
whether
ai
's
decisions
can
totally
replace
human
's
prejudiced
decisions
.
some
people
suggest
that
ai
can
help
reduce
bias
because
it
is
not
emotional
and
no
factors
except
for
the
chosen
ones
will
be
taken
into
consideration
to
make
a
decision
.
in
the
report
,
``
standford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
''
,
the
author
points
out
that
human
's
biased
decisions
may
be
solved
by
artificial
intelligence
algorithms
.
however
,
ai
algorithms
can
also
be
baised
and
will
not
be
able
to
solve
the
issue
easily
.
the
first
potential
bias
of
ai
algorithms
can
be
seen
when
collecting
the
data
.
if
the
collected
data
underrepresents
or
overrepresents
certain
samples
,
traning
such
data
will
result
in
a
biased
model
.
for
example
,
the
research
on
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
by
teenagers
will
be
biased
if
home
schooled
students
or
dropouts
are
not
included
,
but
only
high
school
students
are
in
the
sample
data
.
in
addition
,
if
ai-based
recruiting
tool
is
trained
using
traditional
hiring
decisions
that
favor
men
over
women
,
the
final
model
will
tend
to
hire
more
men
than
women
just
as
it
does
without
an
ai
involvement
.
furthermore
,
another
bias
can
also
be
introduced
in
preparing
data
.
when
a
computer
scientist
creates
a
machine
learning
model
,
he
or
she
decides
to
choose
which
attributes
to
use
for
the
algorithm
.
choosing
attributes
is
a
decision
made
by
a
computer
scientist
and
thus
it
may
lead
to
a
biased
ai
algorithm
.
since
some
data
may
contain
human
decisions
and
it
is
a
human
who
trains
a
model
,
it
is
not
convincing
that
ai
algorithms
can
better
make
unbaised
decisions
than
humans
.
according
to
the
report
,
the
author
notes
that
there
is
not
a
considerable
evidence
to
support
that
ai
robots
can
improve
students
'
academic
performance
.
nevertheless
,
ai
can
play
a
significant
role
in
educational
resources
to
help
promote
student
's
school
performance
.
according
to
``
education
professor
developing
ai-driven
virtual
classroom
''
(2016)
,
an
ai
based
virtual
reality
classroom
was
employed
for
students
seeking
to
be
teachers
.
this
technology
has
shown
improvement
in
their
teaching
skills
and
techniques
.
since
it
is
difficult
for
those
students
to
get
a
real
world
experence
before
becoming
a
teacher
,
the
ai
virtual
reality
classroom
can
serve
as
a
good
training
resource
for
those
who
have
not
been
exposed
to
real
world
classroom
.
another
important
aspect
of
ai
to
denote
in
education
other
than
students
'
academic
performance
is
that
it
enhances
teachers
'
performance
in
school
as
well
.
``

points
out
that
teachers
can
benefit
from
intelligent
tutoring
system
,
a
computer
tutoring
system
based
on
artificial
intelligence
.
for
instance
,
when
a
lecture
is
larger
than
a
typical
one
,
it
is
challenging
for
an
instructor
to
meet
the
demands
of
every
single
student
.
however
,
the
ai
based
tutoring
system
allows
an
instructor
to
analyze
students
'
needs
and
performances
to
conveniently
handle
a
significant
number
of
students
in
class
.
while
there
is
some
justification
for
the
claim
that
ai
is
not
beneficial
for
human-beings
,
the
use
of
ai
technology
is
already
prevalent
in
daily
lives
.
it
is
not
questionable
that
people
reap
benefits
from
embracing
artificial
intelligence
