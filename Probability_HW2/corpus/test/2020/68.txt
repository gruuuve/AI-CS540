even
though
ai
is
really
helpful
for
detecting
crimes
,
it
may
actually
increase
crime
committing
rate
.
one
point
in
the
report
is
that
as
labor
becomes
a
less
important
factor
in
production
as
compared
to
owning
intellectual
capital
,
a
majority
of
citizens
may
find
the
value
of
their
labor
insufficient
to
pay
for
a
socially
acceptable
standard
of
living
.
in
other
words
,
many
people
will
lose
their
jobs
because
of
ai
taking
over
their
positions
.
ai
will
replace
many
low-paid
labor
forces
,
and
open
a
few
new
positions
regarding
to
ai
.
these
new
positions
will
have
some
higher
education
requirements
and
will
be
highly
competitive
.
most
people
who
work
as
labor
force
before
will
remain
unemployed
.
as
a
trend
,
global
population
is
increasing
,
which
means
there
are
more
and
more
people
joining
the
labor
force
.
with
the
overall
number
of
jobs
decreasing
,
there
will
be
fewer
positions
available
for
young
people
who
just
join
the
labor
force
.
as
a
result
,
the
unemployment
rate
will
keep
increasing
and
the
wealth
gap
will
become
larger
and
larger
.
with
no
income
,
people
who
become
unemployed
will
have
a
higher
rate
of
committing
crime
.
even
if
they
know
ai
can
easily
detect
crimes
,
they
will
still
have
a
chance
of
taking
the
risk
because
that
will
be
one
of
the
easiest
ways
for
them
to
survive
in
the
society
.
in
order
to
prevent
this
from
happening
,
there
must
be
some
interference
,
such
as
government
creating
policy
that
will
ensure
the
standard
living
of
unemployed
.
however
,
if
there
is
no
interference
being
made
,
then
the
development
of
ai
will
definitely
increase
crime
committing
rate
.
moreover
,
even
if
ai
does
eliminate
some
types
of
crime
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
might
increase
the
amount
of
cyber-attacks
.
if
human
can
develop
ai
,
then
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
disable
it
.
most
crime
commitment
will
be
cyber-attacks
because
committing
other
crime
will
be
easily
caught
.
according
to
the
report
,
our
society
will
become
more
ai-based
in
the
future
.
people
will
have
more
knowledge
about
ai
.
no
matter
how
many
laws
are
enforced
,
there
will
always
be
some
people
committing
crime
.
the
development
of
ai
just
makes
the
commitment
shift
to
online
crimes
.
it
doesn
t
really
solve
the
problem
.
hackers
can
hack
into
anything
to
do
what
they
want
.
even
having
ai
will
be
helpful
on
detecting
white
collar
crimes
,
a
cyber
attack
may
prevent
such
detection
.
overall
,
ai
can
only
be
seen
as
a
tool
that
will
high
likely
to
change
the
structure
of
our
society
.
during
its
development
,
government
has
to
have
some
regulations
,
or
it
will
affect
public
safety
and
security
in
a
negative
way
.
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
it
will
really
reduce
crime
commitment
.
as
a
tool
,
it
doesn
t
have
any
positive
or
negative
meaning
.
it
is
just
neutral
.
how
people
will
be
using
it
really
determines
whether
it
makes
positive
or
negative
contribution
to
the
society
.
while
most
people
see
it
as
a
tool
to
improve
our
society
,
we
can
not
neglect
the
fact
that
some
people
will
just
use
it
as
a
tool
to
benefit
themselves
,
even
through
illegal
process
.
