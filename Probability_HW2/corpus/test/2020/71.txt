after
reading
the
``
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
''
,
i
gained
a
lot
of
knowledge
about
what
is
the
definition
of
ai
and
what
it
is
capable
of
.
it
is
really
helpful
for
me
in
taking
classes
and
learning
things
about
ai
.
furthermore
,
i
am
very
interested
in
ai
field
,
and
i
am
planning
to
get
an
ai
related
job
in
the
future
.
however
,
i
want
to
challenge
some
of
the
points
from
this
report
,
as
those
issues
were
not
addressed
properly
or
accurately
.
first
,
the
whole
report
is
based
on
the
cities
in
north
america
,
mostly
in
the
us
.
i
understand
this
is
the
basis
of
where
this
report
want
to
cover
,
and
where
the
study
panel
members
are
from
,
but
in
fact
,
ai
is
not
only
a
regional
topic
,
but
also
a
huge
global
term
.
it
is
a
more
broad
term
rather
than
the
small
scope
of
north
america
,
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
the
place
where
has
the
most
advanced
ai
technology
.
i
think
this
report
should
not
narrows
the
terms
of
ai
in
a
small
scope
of
north
america
,
which
is
inappropriate
for
a
mankind
technology
.
instead
,
it
should
mention
ai
related
issues
going
on
in
other
countries
in
this
world
,
like
in
japan
,
china
,
europe
.
these
countries
or
districts
are
also
crucial
in
the
upcoming
ai
trend
,
because
they
will
have
huge
effects
in
labor
,
technology
,
marketing
aspects
and
so
on
.
second
,
in
the
report
it
talks
about
ai
in
healthcare
.
the
problem
is
ai
may
gather
too
much
information
from
individuals
,
no
matter
if
it
's
necessary
or
not
,
which
will
probably
result
in
an
invasion
of
privacy
.
ai
always
tends
to
learn
more
information
than
it
is
supposed
to
,
and
many
companies
may
take
advantage
of
those
information
to
do
things
profitable
for
themselves
.
these
can
be
normal
incidents
,
but
can
also
lead
to
very
dangerous
situations
like
medical
negligence
.
and
what
i
am
most
concerned
about
is
that
no
one
can
guarantee
that
this
will
not
happen
.
just
like
all
the
ads
nowadays
,
many
internet
companies
spy
on
our
private
information
to
accurately
presents
ads
,
and
no
one
can
stop
it
.
it
just
happened
so
naturally
.
but
what
's
different
is
that
ads
are
not
likely
to
lead
to
life
danger
,
but
medical
issues
can
.
so
there
really
should
be
strict
enforcement
about
how
al
should
do
its
job
properly
in
healthcare
before
it
can
even
get
involved
.
last
thing
is
that
in
the
report
about
online
learning
section
it
says
:
``
certain
technologies
have
been
shown
to
create
neurological
side
effects
''
,
which
is
true
but
overlooking
big
problems
come
from
it
.
doing
all
the
learning
online
without
in-class
interactions
with
other
students
or
teachers
actually
harms
normal
children
way
more
than
they
can
benefit
from
it
.
with
phones
and
other
electronic
devices
,
children
nowadays
are
already
too
addicted
to
them
.
and
this
is
causing
children
to
lose
their
ability
to
communicate
with
others
,
and
impairs
their
ability
to
deal
with
things
in
real
life
.
imaging
if
we
replace
all
the
studies
forms
with
much
more
efficient
but
self
online
studies
,
children
will
become
tremendously
autistic
.
and
i
do
not
think
that
will
bring
a
bright
future
for
mankind
.
