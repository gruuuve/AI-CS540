's
report
on
the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
provides
a
very
detailed
overview
of
the
ai
and
the
capabilities
that
it
has
and
could
achieve
in
the
future
.
from
looking
from
what
artificial
intelligence
is
to
what
it
could
do
for
different
sectors
of
society
in
the
future
,
the
report
gives
its
readers
a
grand
look
at
what
could
be
achieved
by
ai
.
however
,
not
everything
that
is
stated
is
necessarily
as
simple
as
the
authors
make
it
out
to
seem
.
the
report
does
overlook
some
issues
outside
of
the
realm
of
technology
.
while
it
brings
up
ethics
,
the
report
does
choose
to
skip
over
the
practicality
of
certain
issues
that
could
be
assisted
or
solved
with
the
help
of
ai
.
the
one
in
particular
that
caught
my
eye
reading
is
ai
's
use
within
the
medical
field
.
also
,
while
the
report
does
shine
a
light
on
the
usefulness
of
ai
,
the
practicality
of
some
potential
advancements
in
the
medical
field
seems
flawed
.
this
section
of
the
report
makes
assumptions
that
are
n't
necessarily
true
across
the
globe
,
such
as
clinics
,
hospitals
,
or
certain
medical
facilities
have
the
funding
to
afford
these
ai
to
help
with
their
work
.
while
advancements
in
ai
will
help
change
the
society
and
the
world
as
we
know
it
for
the
better
,
the
possibilities
that
artificial
intelligence
has
,
according
to
this
report
seem
flawed
and
unrealistic
.
a
point
that
the
stanford
report
attempts
to
make
is
that
,
with
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
within
the
clinical
setting
,
the
physician
's
workload
could
be
less
strenuous
as
it
may
be
now
.
using
ai
,
physicians
,
when
diagnosing
patients
,
could
use
its
assistance
to
help
diagnose
a
patient
's
symptoms
and
have
the
ai
evaluate
said
symptoms
to
find
out
which
disease
the
patient
might
be
suffering
from
.
however
,
to
achieve
this
,
the
report
states
that
''
...
clinicians
must
be
involved
and
engaged
at
the
outset
to
ensure
that
systems
are
well-engineered
and
trusted
''
(26)
.
having
clinicians
be
in
on
the
process
of
developing
ai
does
seem
promising
,
but
maybe
more
convoluted
than
it
seems
.
having
a
clinician
or
doctor
to
work
with
developers
takes
physicians
away
from
patients
that
need
them
at
the
moment
.
while
this
may
seem
minuscule
to
some
,
seeing
patients
should
be
a
clinician
's
priority
.
working
with
developers
and
overseeing
their
work
requires
one
,
time
away
from
patients
that
may
need
them
and
two
,
somewhat
of
knowledge
about
how
ai
works
so
they
can
understand
the
capabilities
and
the
reality
of
what
they
're
asking
out
of
one
.
in
my
eyes
,
this
is
a
time-consuming
proposition
that
the
report
makes
without
thinking
of
the
costs
and
repercussions
that
may
occur
due
to
it
.
the
other
main
issue
that
this
report
does
n't
acknowledge
is
how
these
proposals
only
work
in
facilities
that
can
afford
this
technology
.
within
the
entire
section
of
ai
in
the
medical
world
,
there
was
n't
one
instance
where
the
report
speaks
on
how
facilities
with
lesser
funding
would
be
able
to
utilize
ai
.
the
sort
of
technology
comes
with
its
costs
that
some
facilities
,
especially
ones
in
low-income
neighborhoods
or
rural
facilities
may
not
have
the
funding
to
afford
.
ai
's
use
should
be
implemented
in
every
clinic
,
not
just
the
ones
that
can
afford
it
.
without
it
,
facilities
face
two
main
problems
,
losing
patients
as
they
might
leave
to
hospitals
with
better
equipment
or
losing
patients
due
to
the
lack
of
assistance
that
ai
would
have
provided
in
assisting
physicians
.
this
report
should
be
looking
at
the
costs
and
the
potential
repercussions
of
these
possibilities
,
not
just
the
advantages
of
the
advancements
with
ai
.
