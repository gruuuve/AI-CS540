artificial
intelligence
has
become
widespread
in
different
areas
in
ways
people
might
not
have
noticed
.
according
to
the
article
,
``
artificial
intelligence
and
life
in
2030
,
''
which
thoroughly
summarizes
and
examines
the
current
and
future
development
of
ai
in
north
american
cities
,
ai
will
have
a
profound
impact
on
all
aspects
of
human
life
including
healthcare
and
education
.
however
,
without
an
in-depth
understanding
of
the
characteristics
of
each
industry
and
its
job
request
,
how
far
ai
can
go
might
remain
a
controversial
question
in
different
domains
.
one
example
is
that
the
potential
of
ai
in
healthcare
is
underestimated
.
the
author
states
that
ai
can
be
applied
to
personal
health
data
collection
and
surgical
assistance
under
strict
privacy
restrictions
.
however
,
the
capability
of
ai
is
so
immense
that
it
might
replace
most
of
the
jobs
in
a
hospital
.
first
of
all
,
ai
has
a
large
database
that
one
single
human
being
can
never
compete
with
.
this
database
that
combines
patients
'
health
records
,
information
of
symptoms
and
prescriptions
,
as
well
as
past
treatment
can
make
a
diagnosis
in
the
most
efficient
way
.
therefore
,
ai
will
no
longer
be
a
source
of
information
for
doctors
to
make
use
of
but
in
fact
,
become
a
doctor
that
allows
individuals
to
keep
track
of
their
health
conditions
at
any
time
and
get
accurate
treatment
.
second
,
the
accuracy
and
precision
of
ai
will
make
ai
an
important
technique
in
surgical
operations
.
compared
to
traditional
approaches
,
ai
can
decrease
error
rates
when
predicting
risks
,
analyze
tomography
images
,
and
evaluate
clinical
data

third
,
opposite
from
the
author
's
claim
that
there
is
a
risk
that
patients
'
privacy
may
be
intruded
,
ai
can
help
promote
confidentiality
in
medical
.
in
the
future
,
all
the
information
will
be
stored
in
the
cloud
and
security
verification
will
be
needed
whenever
accessing
the
database
.
moreover
,
anonymous
diagnosis
and
long-distance
treatment
may
come
true
.
in
this
way
,
ai
can
be
applied
to
many
of
the
healthcare-related
problems
across
a
wide
variety
of
forms
,
far
from
most
people
can
expect
.
different
from
healthcare
,
the
application
of
ai
in
early
childhood
education
should
be
constrained
more
.
today
in
many
developed
countries
,
online
intelligent
enlightenment
materials
have
become
popular
but
regulations
regarding
this
have
been
absent
for
a
long
period
.
believing
that
in
this
highly
informational
society
,
this
early
exposure
to
technology
will
help
their
kids
succeed
when
they
grow
up
,
parents
are
fascinated
by
all
these
varied
courses
such
as
kids
programming
.
however
,
in
the
early
stage
of
childhood
development
,
children
are
not
mature
enough
to
fully
understand
the
reasoning
behind
the
complicated
code
.
according
to
rudolf
steiner
,
a
famous
german
educationist
,
for
children
of
7
years
old
or
younger
,
sufficient
and
appropriate
physical
activities
are
important
for
children
's
physical
growth
and
mental
development

too
much
or
too
early
exposure
to
the
internet
and
technology
can
prevent
them
from
building
a
close
connection
to
the
environment
and
improving
imagination
.
moreover
,
more
time
spent
in
front
of
a
screen
can
seriously
affect
the
visual
development
of
a
child
and
eventually
lead
to
lower
his
or
her
well-being
.
therefore
,
the
future
development
and
application
of
ai
in
early
childhood
education
must
be
under
stringent
conditions
and
constrained
in
a
certain
range
.
