throughout
history
,
technological
advancements
have
changed
the
daily
lives
of
people
around
the
world
and
have
made
mankind
exponentially
more
productive
.
in
our
time
,
a
new
and
powerful
technological
advancement
is
on
the
rise
:
artificial
intelligence
.
artificial
intelligence
puts
machines
one
step
closer
to
humans
,
giving
them
the
ability
to
make
informed
decisions
and
judgements
without
a
human
directly
telling
them
what
choice
to
make
.
in
many
cases
,
this
allows
computers
to
make
certain
processes
that
were
previously
left
to
humans
even
faster
;
in
some
cases
,
the
machines
are
even
better
decision
makers
.
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
explores
the
many
applications
of
ai
and
its
predicted
future
in
various
fields
.
one
of
these
fields
is
the
transportation
system
.
the
study
estimates
that
self
driving
cars
will
be
widely
accepted
in
the
coming
years
,
but
personally
,
this
seems
overly
optimistic
.
a
current
trend
is
that
people
are
generally
slow
to
trust
newer
technology
.
take
for
example
,
the
google
home
assistant
or
amazon
's
alexa
.
many
people
stay
away
from
these
useful
devices
because
they
are
skeptical
of
the
devices
spying
on
them
and
other
similar
privacy
concerns
.
since
many
are
skeptical
of
these
``
smart
''
devices
,
i
believe
that
it
will
take
more
time
for
self
driving
vehicles
to
become
mainstream
.
many
people
may
be
concerned
with
the
vehicle
logging
their
location
or
otherwise
invading
their
privacy
.
also
,
there
is
a
whole
group
of
people
who
enjoy
modifying
and
driving
their
own
cars
.
this
group
will
also
be
likely
to
avoid
self
driving
vehicles
since
it
would
threaten
one
of
their
hobbies
.
these
groups
may
also
be
opposed
to
policies
that
favor
self
driving
vehicles
over
traditional
ones
for
the
same
reason
.
the
last
reason
that
i
believe
will
cause
self
driving
cars
to
take
longer
to
become
mainstream
is
the
ethics
and
morality
of
certain
decisions
that
need
to
be
made
by
the
car
.
there
is
the
classic
question
of
which
of
two
people
should
be
prioritized
if
the
car
detects
an
imminent
fatal
accident
.
i
expect
there
to
be
much
debate
on
how
a
vehicle
should
decide
who
should
be
saved
in
such
a
situation
.
furthermore
,
some
people
may
decide
that
machines
should
not
be
able
to
make
this
decision
at
all
,
which
could
delay
the
spread
of
self
driving
cars
even
more
.
self
driving
vehicles
appear
to
be
far
from
the
norm
at
the
moment
.
until
people
warm
up
to
them
,
they
will
stay
out
of
the
spotlight
and
car
companies
will
not
produce
self
driving
cars
.
in
order
for
people
to
trust
in
technology
like
this
,
they
need
time
to
see
that
the
technology
is
there
to
help
them
.
because
of
this
,
i
believe
that
the
initial
artificial
intelligence
advancements
will
be
made
in
the
healthcare
field
or
the
home
service
field
.
such
advancements
would
show
people
that
artificially
intelligent
systems
can
carry
out
tasks
faster
and
more
efficiently
than
many
humans
.
after
this
initial
trust
is
established
,
people
will
begin
to
allow
similar
technology
into
more
aspects
of
their
life
,
like
their
method
of
transportation
.
