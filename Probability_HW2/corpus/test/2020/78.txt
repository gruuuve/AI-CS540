automation
has
raised
concerns
amongst
people
since
it
was
first
introduced
that
it
may
negatively
impact
the
job
market
.
since
the
advent
of
machines
that
are
capable
of
doing
strenuous
,
repetitive
tasks
more
efficiently
and
relieve
the
need
for
an
excessive
amount
of
manpower
to
achieve
similar
amounts
of
output
,
it
has
been
a
constant
lurking
fear
amongst
many
people
that
automation
will
one
day
eradicate
all
jobs
rendering
huge
sectors
of
the
population
essentially
jobless
.
recent
developments
in
processing
power
enabling
artificial
intelligence
to
be
trained
to
closely
mimic
human
cognitive
abilities
has
added
to
this
worry
over
unemployment
.
the
claims
over
loss
of
jobs
are
shallow
and
false
since
the
job
market
is
undergoing
the
usual
structural
change
with
newer
jobs
simply
moving
to
other
sectors
or
totally
new
sectors
that
did
not
exist
before
.
many
of
these
newer
sectors
are
closely
related
to
developing
and
maintaining
these
new
technologies
and
curbing
its
development
will
counterintuitively
lead
to
a
decline
in
the
number
of
jobs
.
artificial
intelligence
and
automation
will
replace
work
but
not
lead
to
an
eventual
decline
in
the
total
number
jobs
since
they
complement
humans
rather
than
totally
replace
them
,
create
new
jobs
and
opportunities
and
contribute
to
better
efficiency
and
safety
increasing
output
and
willingness
of
people
to
work
.
the
main
point
put
forth
by
people
against
automation
is
that
it
will
take
away
a
lot
of
jobs
leading
to
mass
unemployment
.
frey
and
osborne
at
university
of
oxford
conducted
a
study
to
evaluate
how
susceptible
jobs
are
to
being
replaced
by
automation
in
the
united
states
.
they
concluded
that
with
the
advancement
of
robots
and
their
improvements
in
dexterity
and
precision
,
around
47
%
of
jobs
are
at
risk
of
being
automated

these
results
although
only
suggest
that
jobs
may
be
at
risk
and
not
necessarily
be
outright
replaced
.
technology
can
also
be
very
unpredictable
which
should
be
accounted
for
when
judging
such
claims
.
jobs
being
replaced
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
decline
in
number
of
jobs
available
since
this
has
a
cascading
effect
in
the
job
market
,
creating
job
in
other
sectors
causing
a
transition
.
vermeulen
,
kesselhut
,
pyka
(2018)
and
saviotti
conducted
a
study
to
investigate
the
effects
of
the
development
of
automation
and
ai
in
different
economic
sectors
and
how
they
affect
the
availability
of
jobs
-lrb-
p.

-rrb-
.
they
concluded
that
automation
has
led
to
a
decline
in
job
numbers
in
the
production
,
trade
and
office
support
sectors
but
has
led
to
an
increase
in
other
sectors
such
as
management
and
engineering
sectors
,
thus
indicating
a
structural
change
in
the
job
market
and
not
decline
in
number
of
jobs
.
this
suggests
that
the
adoption
of
automation
is
merely
causing
a
shift
in
employment
sectors
as
the
job
market
experiences
a
routine
structural
change
.
thus
,
ai
and
automation
are
not
leading
up
to
an
eventual
drought
in
the
job
market
and
the
claims
made
over
this
phenomenon
are
mere
possibilities
which
not
be
confused
for
actual
causation
.
in
addition
to
creating
new
jobs
,
automation
also
complements
current
jobs
where
it
does
not
take
over
the
task
.
automation
complements
humans
by
performing
repetitive
tasks
and
increasing
output
and
by
decreasing
work
.
grossman
,
sorells
,
chessell
,

(2018)
conducted
a
study
to
examine
how
automation
can
affect
the
job
market
-lrb-

-rrb-
.
they
concluded
that
ai
has
outperformed
humans
in
these
sectors
with
its
efficiency
and
higher
proficiency
however
humans
will
still
be
complements
to
robots
in
the
short
term
,
improving
human
workers
instead
of
replacing
them
since
machines
eradicate
work
,
not
jobs

.
there
is
no
point
in
competing
with
ai
over
jobs
since
it
is
better
at
certain
tasks
than
humans
and
can
thus
be
beneficial
to
us
in
performing
these
tasks
more
efficiently
.
estlund
(2018)
points
that
there
is
a
current
shortage
of
laborers
as
unemployment
rates
fall
to
a
sizeable
low
in
recent
history
-lrb-
p.

-rrb-
.
new
technologies
through
complementing
human
workers
are
able
to
increase
output
and
as
a
result
can
actually
help
counteract
this
labor
shortage
.
the
complementing
nature
can
be
beneficial
in
other
ways
to
humans
too
besides
just
removing
the
inconvenience
of
strenuous
tasks
.
through
the
productivity
gains
,
the
value
of
labor
is
actually
increased
which
can
translate
into
higher
wages
in
certain
cases
thus
improving
the
overall
economy

adopting
machines
has
desirable
outcomes
as
it
leads
to
more
monetary
gains
by
doing
less
strenuous
work
overall
.
thus
,
automation
complements
humans
instead
of
replacing
them
outright
and
these
lead
to
gain
in
productivity
and
easing
the
work
of
humans
by
letting
the
machines
do
the
hard
work
and
even
leading
to
higher
earning
in
some
cases
as
a
consequence
of
the
increased
productivity
and
higher
overall
value
of
labor
.
