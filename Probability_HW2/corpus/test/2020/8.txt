as
artificial
intelligence
advances
it
begins
to
leave
the
society
that
we
once
knew
in
the
past
.
jobs
that
existed
previously
are
disappearing
as
computers
learn
to
do
them
better
and
faster

.
in
the
future
,
as
the
technology
and
algorithms
get
better
,
the
landscape
of
life
in
general
is
going
to
change
.
at
least
the
landscape
of
the
places
that
can
afford
this
technology
.
by
basing
this
study
in
united
states
cities
-lrb-
page

-rrb-
,
the
study
makes
the
mistake
of
leaving
out
80
%
of
the
u.s.
population
in
rural
areas
and
hundreds
of
countries
around
the
world
who
lack
the
money
,
infrastructure
and
companies
to
prosper
from
it
a.i.
effectively
.
the
united
states
is
the
world
s
largest
economy
by
a
broad
margin
,
giving
us
the
necessary
resources
to
use
a.i.
to
its
greatest
effect
.
the
high-powered
computation
and
large-scale
data
that
fuel
-lrb-
s
-rrb-
a.i.
is
simply
just
not
as
accessible
in
rural
areas
in
the
united
states
or
in
poorer
countries
around
the
world
(43)
.
this
lack
of
accessibility
will
likely
lead
to
far
greater
use
in
the
cities
that
can
support
its
large
requirements
,
well
leaving
the
other
cities
even
further
behind
then
before
.
to
combat
this
disparity
in
technology
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
united
states
keeps
it
a.i
research
as
open
and
comprehensive
as
possible
so
that
it
can
be
recycled
in
nations
less
fortunate
.
despite
this
though
it
is
doubtful
that
without
the
technology
to
take
personalized
data
as
effectively
in
poorer
regions
that
the
information
will
lack
effectiveness
.
for
these
reasons
it
is
likely
that
the
effect
of
a.i.
will
fall
short
of
regions
of
poverty
,
leaving
them
behind
.
like
money
but
not
quite
the
same
,
the
cities
of
the
united
states
that
this
report
focuses
on
all
have
one
thing
in
common
,
vast
infrastructure
.
to
help
with
public
safety
cameras
can
be
deployed
(36)
and
to
help
with
road
congestion
infrared
loops
,
microwave
sensors
and
radar
can
be
used
(21)
.
the
issue
is
that
these
things
do
not
currently
exist
in
rural
areas
that
either
lack
the
money
or
are
simply
to
spread
out
for
them
to
be
as
effective
.
to
fix
this
it
would
be
possible
to
try
and
balance
the
amount
of
resources
that
go
towards
modernization
without
considering
population
,
but
even
with
this
issue
arise
.
in
the
end
it
might
make
the
most
sense
that
the
areas
of
greatest
population
be
targeted
as
it
would
be
the
most
efficient
,
but
that
doesn
t
mean
that
the
rural
towns
should
be
left
out
entirely
.
lastly
is
the
united
states
prowess
for
technology
and
hosting
the
largest
tech
companies
.
the
u.s.
has
home
court
advantage
for
all
the
biggest
a.i.
firms
,
such
as
microsoft
,
apple
,
and
facebook
.
going
back
to
the
money
as
all
things
eventually
do
,
being
the
largest
economy
,
companies
have
the
most
incentive
to
implement
this
technology
here
.
there
influence
is
so
great
they
have
even
managed
seats
on
the
study
panel
(3)
.
this
final
limitation
of
the
a.i.
s
reach
provides
no
great
solution
,
the
issue
being
that
the
companies
will
always
follow
the
money
something
hard
to
avoid
.
though
the
paper
is
sound
on
many
ideas
it
is
lacking
in
one
of
the
most
important
areas
.
in
its
effort
to
show
the
effectiveness
of
a.i.
in
specific
fields
it
failed
to
truly
access
the
use
of
a.i.
outside
on
environment
,
making
the
paper
much
less
useful
for
the
billions
that
fall
outside
of
its
scope
.
hopefully
these
shortcomings
can
be
addressed
better
in
2030
as
is
mentioned
.
