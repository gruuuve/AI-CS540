's
society
,
artificial
intelligence
-lrb-
ai
-rrb-
is
viewed
with
the
possibility
to
be
the
most
useful
development
for
the
human
race
or
create
more
problems
than
the
ones
it
tries
to
solve
.
the
latter
stems
from
pop
culture
and
media
creating
unnecessary
distrust
in
artificial
intelligence
.
for
those
uneducated
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
or
computer
science
,
it
's
difficult
to
understand
how
a
machine
using
ai
makes
decisions
.
in
the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
,
the
study
panel
analyzed
how
there
is
a
distrust
in
artificial
intelligence
but
did
not
include
all
effective
strategies
to
alleviate
the
public
's
distrust
that
has
stemmed
from
improper
exposure
of
ai
from
the
media
.
an
example
of
distrust
the
panel
analyzes
is
critical
mistakes
made
through
self
driving
cars
.
in
the
report
,
the
stanford
study
explains
``
though
accidents
in
a
self
driving
car
may
be
less
probable
than
those
driven
by
humans
,
for
example
,
they
will
attract
more
attention
''
(46)
.
in
today
's
media
,
popular
media
outlets
are
more
likely
to
create
reports
about
accidents
that
are
created
by
self
driving
cars
or
other
ai
related
machines
.
the
reason
they
do
that
is
not
to
show
that
they
're
potentially
more
dangerous
,
but
because
it
's
more
interesting
for
someone
to
read
thus
creating
more
revenue
for
the
company
.
this
in
turn
creates
unnecessary
distrust
in
ai
.
in
order
for
the
public
to
truly
trust
in
artificial
intelligence
for
fully
automated
driving
,
concrete
statistics
of
accidents
with
driverless
cars
versus
driving
normally
need
to
be
developed
.
to
help
alleviate
the
distrust
from
ai
's
decision
making
,
the
panel
discussed
some
possible
strategies
to
implement
ai
in
the
future
.
when
the
panel
considered
strategies
to
help
the
public
trust
in
ai
,
they
did
not
consider
how
shaping
the
media
can
change
people
's
opinions
.
instead
,
the
panel
suggests
to
``
design
strategies
that
enhance
the
ability
of
humans
to
understand
ai
systems
and
decisions
-lrb-
such
as
explicitly
explaining
those
decisions
-rrb-
,
and
to
participate
in
their
use
,
may
help
build
trust
and
prevent
drastic
failures
''
(46)
.
this
is
not
an
effective
strategy
for
all
applications
given
how
the
media
has
shaped
artificial
intelligence
to
be
perceived
by
the
public
.
for
example
,
a
possible
key
application
for
ai
is
in
healthcare
through
surgery
.
a
properly
devised
ai
surgeon
machine
could
be
more
effective
than
a
highly
trained
surgeon
,
but
some
users
may
not
want
an
ai
for
their
personal
surgery
due
to
their
distrust
from
the
media
.
as
long
as
the
person
being
affected
by
ai
can
have
concrete
evidence
that
the
particular
machine
using
artificial
intelligence
is
safer
and
more
efficient
,
having
humans
understand
how
the
ai
makes
decisions
may
become
irrelevant
and
unnecessary
for
those
that
trust
in
statistics
.
after
proper
pro
ai
statistics
have
been
developed
,
it
's
important
for
the
media
to
help
the
smooth
transition
of
implementing
artificial
intelligence
.
the
panel
made
very
good
points
on
how
useful
ai
can
be
for
the
economy
,
health
care
,
transportation
and
entertainment
.
over
the
next
100
years
that
this
study
occur
,
more
statistical
evidence
of
how
ai
can
truly
impact
our
world
will
arise
to
help
ensure
trust
for
everyone
that
will
be
affected
by
the
technology
.
to
transform
the
panel
's
ideas
into
reality
,
it
's
necessary
for
the
public
to
become
more
comfortable
with
ai
through
a
developed
strategy
of
presenting
unbiased
statistical
information
of
how
the
world
can
become
better
by
utilizing
ai
's
capabilities
into
their
daily
lives
.
