reflection
on
the
``
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
''
as
research
and
development
into
ai
technology
becomes
increasingly
more
popular
and
profitable
,
its
impact
on
society
at
large
is
becoming
an
increasing
concern
.
the
100
year
study
-lrb-
100ys
-rrb-
seeks
to
give
a
surface
level
analysis
of
emerging
ai
trends
and
developments
and
make
some
limited
predictions
about
the
impact
of
ai
in
the
future
.
the
most
immediate
place
that
ai
will
have
an
impact
on
society
is
self-driving
cars
.
the
100ys
,
in
its
current
iteration
,
has
a
``
thematic
focus
on
``
ai
and
life
in
2030
''
.
they
envision
a
possible
scenario
where
most
commercial
uses
of
vehicles
are
now
automated
,
specifically
looking
at
ridesharing
,
trucking
and
other
delivery
services
.
though
the
overall
prediction
that
these
types
of
jobs
will
eventually
be
automated
is
correct
,
the
timeline
of
these
vehicles
being
accepted
by
2030
,
is
an
ambitious
claim
.
first
,
there
is
the
issue
of
the
current
hostility
towards
automation
.
the
2016
election
saw
a
fevered
campaign
by
donald
trump
,
who
made
broad
promises
to
bring
back
manufacturing
jobs
that
had
been
lost
to
overseas
competition
.
this
carried
him
to
the
eventual
presidency
.
how
does
this
relate
to
the
automation
debate
?
whether
one
loses
a
job
to
a
foreign
country
or
to
an
ai
the
result
is
the
same
.
for
all
the
benefits
that
ai
could
bring
to
this
sector
,
it
is
the
human
element
that
needs
to
be
overcome
.
people
will
fight
for
their
jobs
,
even
if
those
jobs
wo
n't
be
there
in
the
future
.
the
100ys
identifies
a
confusing
area
concerning
these
emerging
technologies
and
their
interaction
with
respect
to
the
law
.
this
issue
of
liability
regarding
autonomous
vehicles
will
need
to
be
comprehensively
addressed
at
some
point
,
but
laws
and
lawmakers
are
generally
slow
to
act
.
in
2018
,
an
autonomously
driven
vehicle
,
operated
by
uber
,
killed
a
pedestrian
(1)
.
who
is
responsible
?
is
it
the
car
manufacturer
,
the
company
who
developed
the
self-driving
ai
or
someone
else
?
these
are
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
conclusively
if
any
broad
scale
adoption
of
these
technologies
is
to
be
implemented
.
in
order
to
see
the
broad
application
of
these
technologies
,
federal
intervention
will
be
needed
.
currently
,
the
states
decide
to
make
and
enforce
traffic
laws
such
as
who
can
be
on
the
road
.
how
can
one
expect
to
run
an
otr
trucking
business
if
they
would
have
to
avoid
entire
states
due
to
different
liability
and
driver
laws
?
the
determination
of
what
is
a
driver
will
need
to
be
addressed
.
laws
take
a
long
time
to
develop
and
implement
,
and
regarding
ai
and
autonomous
vehicles
the
current
legal
landscape
is
barren
.
in
conclusion
,
the
claim
that
self-driving
vehicles
will
have
widespread
use
in
commercial
space
for
ridesharing
,
trucking
and
other
delivery
services
by
2030
is
not
likely
.
there
is
currently
a
strong
anti-automation
focus
in
politics
.
the
laws
with
which
we
will
need
to
resolve
liability
disputes
currently
do
not
exist
in
robust
fashion
,
and
the
adoption
of
federal
standards
is
necessary
to
ease
these
technologies
into
common
use
.
