as
time
goes
on
and
technology
progresses
,
humans
'
relationship
with
machines
will
become
more
and
more
personal
.
this
interconnection
between
humans
and
artificial
intelligence
appears
to
be
a
way
to
enhance
everyday
life
,
but
that
change
,
in
reality
,
is
unlikely
to
be
as
effortless
as
expected
,
especially
regarding
self-driving
cars
.
introducing
self-driving
cars
to
society
is
an
abrupt
change
that
will
not
be
adopted
instantaneously
.
it
is
almost
impossible
that
``
traffic
jams
and
parking
challenges
will
become
obsolete
''
with
the
introduction
of
self-driving
transportation
.
(6)
in
an
ideal
world
,
integrating
automated
cars
,
buses
,
and
taxis
could
alleviate
many
headaches
that
driving
can
cause
,
especially
during
rush
hour
and
in
large
cities
.
with
people
no
longer
actually
driving
their
cars
,
traffic
has
the
opportunity
to
run
much
more
smoothly
and
be
distraction-free
,
which
could
cause
fewer
car
accidents
.
many
questions
about
how
this
idealistic
,
artificial
traffic
scheme
could
become
reality
still
persist
,
however
.
it
is
unknown
how
automated
vehicles
will
act
during
extreme
weather
conditions
,
road
construction
,
or
emergencies
.
these
self-driving
cars
must
be
able
to
make
split-second
decisions
that
are
typically
made
by
humans
.
they
must
be
able
to
quickly
and
ethically
evaluate
a
situation
,
which
is
something
robots
typically
do
not
have
to
do
.
it
is
difficult
to
see
a
world
without
traffic
jams
and
parking
problems
.
in
a
world
with
self-driving
cars
,
people
will
still
travel
the
same
amount
as
they
currently
do
or
even
more
often
because
of
the
supposed
ease
of
these
automated
travel
.
with
the
same
amount
of
people
with
the
desire
to
travel
as
currently
exist
,
traffic
jams
are
likely
to
still
persist
.
artificial
intelligence
must
be
able
to
match
the
intelligence
of
its
human
creators
,
especially
on
the
road
.
many
obstacles
stand
in
the
way
of
self-driving
cars
from
taking
over
the
road
,
including
questions
about
ethics
and
equality
.
``
autonomous
transportation
''
will
take
decades
to
perfect
and
will
not
``
soon
be
commonplace
.
''
(18)
before
automated
cars
can
become
widespread
,
the
public
must
learn
to
trust
these
new
inventions
.
the
reliability
and
safety
of
self-driving
cars
must
be
proved
in
a
way
that
invites
people
to
trust
these
supposedly-intelligent
machines
more
than
their
own
instincts
.
humans
are
creatures
that
are
inherently
opposed
to
change
;
humans
like
routine
and
things
they
are
comfortable
with
.
it
would
take
time
and
real
,
genuine
effort
to
change
the
way
people
think
.
making
a
brand-new
,
unknown
,
and
possibly
scary
traffic
system
commonplace
is
not
an
easy
task
.
humans
may
also
not
trust
the
ethics
of
self-driving
cars
,
especially
when
the
cars
must
make
split-second
decisions
in
emergency
situations
.
putting
human
lives
in
the
hands
of
machines
may
not
be
a
comforting
thought
for
many
people
.
self-driving
cars
,
like
any
form
of
groundbreaking
technology
,
also
have
an
expensive
price
tag
.
many
individuals
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
afford
their
own
new
automated
car
,
which
calls
into
question
the
equality
of
creating
a
system
of
solely
automated
vehicles
.
these
cars
have
the
ability
to
further
widen
the
wealth
gap
in
society
.
there
are
many
questions
to
answer
before
self-driving
vehicles
become
america
's
norm
