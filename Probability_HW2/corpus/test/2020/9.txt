the
stanford
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
2016
report
was
written
to
report
on
the
findings
of
the
study
panel
for
the
100
year
study
of
ai
.
the
report
is
targeted
towards
the
general
public
,
industry
,
governments
,
and
ai
researchers
.
however
,
this
paper
falls
short
because
it
fails
to
clearly
state
the
large
negative
impact
that
corporations
have
on
the
future
progress
of
ai
.
the
study
is
concerned
with
the
public
's
perception
of
ai
as
a
privacy
invasion
and
an
imminent
threat
to
humanity
,
and
how
this
could
slow
down
ai
research
and
implementation
-lrb-
pg

-rrb-
.
this
concern
is
understandable
,
as
well
as
important
.
the
study
looks
into
commercial
and
academic
applications
of
ai
,
but
fails
to
state
that
corporate
ai
interests
may
be
the
downfall
of
the
future
of
ai
.
``
companies
such
as
google
,
facebook
,
and
amazon
have
actively
lobbied
to
avoid
being
designated
as
critical
to
the
economy
,
arguing
that
this
would
open
the
door
to
regulation
that
would
inevitably
compromise
their
rapid
product
development
cycles
and
ability
to
innovate
''
-lrb-

.
these
corporations
have
the
sole
goal
of
making
money
.
this
does
not
align
with
the
interest
of
creating
a
better
future
for
all
people
.
this
is
leading
to
the
possible
future
the
study
was
concerned
about
,
where
the
fortunate
few
reap
most
of
the
benefits
of
ai
.
corporations
lobby
the
government
to
have
less
restrictions
,
while
other
research
is
hindered
by
the
many
restrictions
it
faces
.
the
fears
of
privacy
invasion
that
many
people
have
are
brought
on
by
ai
work
done
by
these
corporations
.
it
is
no
secret
that
they
collect
your
data
and
use
it
to
target
advertisements
to
sell
more
products
.
many
people
are
rightfully
disturbed
by
this
,
especially
when
there
are
not
regulations
in
place
to
protect
that
data
,
such
as
there
is
with
sensitive
health
information
.
this
distrust
is
going
to
make
regulations
stricter
,
and
the
regulations
are
mostly
applying
to
ai
research
that
is
not
being
done
by
corporations
.
billionaire
peter
thiel
recently
funded
a
new
ai
startup
that
would
allow
the
user
to
simply
take
a
picture
of
someone
on
the
street
and
learn
their
name
and
address
-lrb-
ref
:1
-rrb-
.
this
is
extremely
privacy
invading
,
and
people
are
rightfully
scared
about
it
.
the
people
who
are
scared
are
right
to
be
,
ai
can
not
progress
in
a
positive
direction
while
it
is
being
used
so
wrongly
.
many
ai
experts
choose
to
work
for
corporations
because
it
is
a
well
paying
career
.
if
companies
can
continue
to
make
profit
from
ai
research
,
they
will
continue
to
hire
many
ai
experts
.
these
experts
are
then
contributing
to
projects
that
focus
on
profit
,
taking
away
from
research
that
could
be
done
in
important
fields
,
such
as
low-resource
communities
.
in
conclusion
,
more
attention
needs
to
be
called
to
the
power
and
negative
effect
corporations
have
on
ai
research
.
if
the
study
group
truly
cares
about
the
positive
future
of
ai
,
they
should
give
this
issue
more
attention
in
the
next
report
.
failing
to
educate
the
public
on
this
problem
will
hinder
the
positive
development
of
ai
research
.
