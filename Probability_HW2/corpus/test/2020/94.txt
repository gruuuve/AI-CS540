there
is
one
thing
that
is
talked
about
within
the
article
,
which
is
the
acceptance
and
deployment
of
autonomous
vehicles
,
that
i
do
not
think
will
happen
the
same
way
as
what
was
said
in
the
article
.
the
main
thing
that
i
do
not
agree
with
is
the
rollout
and
usage
of
autonomous
vehicles
commercially
in
america
.
in
the
article
,
it
is
said
that
the
acceptance
and
deployment
of
autonomous
vehicles
will
be
seen
in
the
near
future
,
but
i
think
that
it
will
take
some
time
for
autonomous
vehicles
to
be
used
commercially
.
some
reasons
that
it
will
take
more
time
than
predicted
in
the
article
are
the
debate
of
who
is
responsible
if
something
goes
wrong
,
as
well
as
laws
and
regulations
that
will
need
to
be
placed
before
vast
deployment
,
along
with
an
improvement
on
the
ai
capabilities
needed
to
release
commercial
autonomous
vehicles
.
one
reason
that
i
think
it
will
take
longer
for
autonomous
vehicles
to
be
accepted
and
deployed
is
because
of
the
laws
and
regulations
that
will
have
to
be
put
in
place
before
fully
autonomous
vehicles
are
accepted
.
the
question
as
to
who
is
at
fault
in
the
case
of
an
accident
will
also
have
to
be
answered
for
the
autonomous
vehicles
to
be
allowed
on
public
roadways
.
not
only
will
the
debate
to
answer
this
question
take
time
,
but
it
will
also
be
highly
publicized
,
and
it
is
possible
for
the
public
acceptance
of
autonomous
vehicles
to
be
hurt
by
the
outcome
of
this
debate
,
which
will
lead
to
further
delays
for
the
deployment
of
these
vehicles
.
this
debate
,
if
a
rather
unfortunate
outcome
is
reached
,
could
further
push
back
the
deployment
of
autonomous
vehicles
,
by
demanding
the
creation
of
laws
and
regulations
that
cause
a
redevelopment
in
how
the
ai
is
designed
,
and
implemented
within
the
autonomous
vehicles
.
another
reason
that
i
think
the
deployment
and
acceptance
of
autonomous
vehicles
will
be
longer
than
the
timeline
brought
up
in
the
article
is
the
developments
in
the
ai
that
are
needed
in
order
to
implement
fully
autonomous
vehicles
.
one
such
development
would
be
the
ability
to
interpret
the
surroundings
,
in
a
less
than
ideal
event
,
such
as
a
rainstorm
or
snowstorm
.
right
now
,
the
current
implementation
in
semi-autonomous
vehicles
uses
a
combination
of
lidar
-lrb-
a
camera
which
uses
lasers
to
make
a
3-d
render
of
the
surroundings
-rrb-
and
stereo
cameras
-lrb-
a
camera
that
has
two
lenses
,
which
is
used
to
measure
depth
for
objects
-rrb-
,
which
are
useful
for
sensing
objects
in
perfect
weather
.
but
when
there
is
a
storm
,
and
there
are
a
vast
number
of
particles
in
the
air
,
the
cameras
do
not
perform
very
well
,
especially
the
lidar
.
this
lack
of
performance
hinders
the
car
from
being
able
to
drive
itself
,
and
calls
for
a
human
to
take
back
control
,
leading
the
vehicle
to
no
longer
be
autonomous
.
this
inability
to
be
fully
autonomous
will
push
back
the
time
until
fully
autonomous
vehicles
are
accepted
and
deployed
commercially
,
which
will
not
arrive
as
soon
as
the
article
hopes
.
