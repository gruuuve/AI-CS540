after
reading
the
article
detailing
the
current
state
of
ai
and
how
the
study
panel
currently
views
certain
topics
and
issues
,
i
have
come
up
with
a
few
counterpoints
to
what
the
reading
discussed
.
first
,
i
would
like
to
speak
on
autonomous
vehicles
and
the
future
they
have
in
our
society
.
and
secondly
,
on
the
advancements
of
ai
in
the
classroom
setting
.
the
panel
suggests
that
self-driving
vehicles
used
for
personal
transportation
will
be
commonplace
in
the
near
future
,
sighting
an
article
that
predicts
self-driving
cars
to
be
widely
adopted
by
2020

.
because
we
have
the
privilege
of
reading
this
report
five
years
into
the
future
,
we
know
this
is
not
the
case
.
and
i
would
argue
it
will
still
be
a
significant
amount
of
time
before
we
see
any
real
transition
into
fully
autonomous
vehicles
.
the
sensor
technology
may
be
there
,
but
the
real
setback
will
be
the
human
trust
needed
for
this
to
really
start
moving
forward
.
people
have
been
driving
their
own
cars
for
hundreds
of
years
,
until
we
can
create
a
system
with
a
significant
decrease
in
the
number
of
accidents
,
i
don
t
think
humans
will
have
the
trust
.
later
in
the
article
it
states
,
though
accidents
in
a
self-driving
car
may
be
less
probable
they
will
attract
more
attention
.

which
drives
home
my
point
that
this
new
autonomous
system
must
be
significantly
better
than
the
current
state
before
we
see
any
serious
transition
.
i
also
challenge
the
article
in
its
suggestion
that
ai
in
education
would
improve
the
classroom
experience
for
a
student
.
while
i
agree
this
technology
may
be
beneficial
in
higher
education
settings
where
the
students
already
have
a
knowledge
base
and
are
more
independent
,
i
think
the
teacher-pupil
connection
is
too
vital
in
a
student
s
growth
during
k-12
to
continue
increasing
class
size
assuming
they
have
ai
assistance
.
although
i
don
t
know
the
cutting-edge
advancements
ai
in
the
classroom
has
made
,
my
experience
would
tell
me
it
isn
t
far
enough
along
to
provide
the
extremely
necessary
personal
experience
for
each
student
,
especially
in
those
very
first
classroom
years
.
void
of
a
personalized
learning
experience
and
less
one-on-one
time
with
the
instructor
would
leave
just
as
many
,
if
not
more
,
students
on
the
outside
,
falling
behind
their
peers
.
along
with
this
,
education
establishments
are
hesitant
to
invest
in
current
ai
,
as
stated
in
the
article
,
schools
and
universities
have
been
slow
in
adopting
ai
technologies
primarily
due
to
lack
of
funds
and
lack
of
solid
evidence
that
they
help
students
achieve
learning
objectives
-lrb-

.
and
this
is
where
i
believe
the
problem
lies
.
schools
have
a
difficult
time
scraping
up
the
money
to
invest
in
improvements
,
and
if
ai
is
unable
to
prove
it
has
a
positive
effect
on
learning
,
it
will
never
be
incorporated
.
and
if
no
institutions
are
willing
to
make
that
investment
,
who
will
be
funding
the
advancement
of
ai
technologies
in
the
classroom
?
the
article
states
,
advances
in
ai
technologies
will
be
developed
and
fielded
gradually
not
in
sudden
-lrb-
page

-rrb-
.
but
until
significant
strides
are
made
in
classroom
ai
where
it
can
be
proven
to
be
beneficial
,
i
don
t
see
how
any
school
will
find
the
funds
to
make
upgrades
to
the
classroom
ai
,
if
they
have
any
,
regardless
of
how
gradual
.
