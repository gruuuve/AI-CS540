the
one
hundred
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
includes
in
its
investigation
a
statement
regarding
the
role
of
public
policy
with
ai
.
with
continued
ai
development
and
an
increase
in
usage
of
the
technology
,
the
study
raises
concerns
over
potential
negative
consequences
as
ai
becomes
more
powerful
and
prevalent
in
society
.
in
response
to
ai
's
growth
,
regulations
may
be
the
government
's
solution
,
yet
the
study
states
that
this
is
not
ideal
since
regulations
hinder
innovation
.
however
,
i
disagree
with
these
statements
.
i
believe
that
as
ai
's
scope
increases
,
regulations
must
follow
in
order
to
protect
and
preserve
society
from
negative
consequences
of
this
new
technology
,
which
will
settle
safety
and
inequality
concerns
.
although
innovation
is
a
vital
aspect
of
societal
development
,
i
do
not
believe
that
innovation
should
be
placed
over
the
value
of
ample
security
.
with
great
strides
already
made
in
ai
with
more
to
come
,
regulations
help
check
these
new
abilities
to
avoid
harming
users
.
considering
that
the
average
user
knows
very
little
about
how
ai
works
,
they
fail
to
see
potential
dangers
to
their
privacy
associated
with
purchasing
and
using
a
new
smart
device
.
although
companies
do
have
incentives
to
keep
their
ai
technologies
safe
and
secure
,
as
they
are
able
to
market
their
devices
as
such
,
security
is
usually
not
at
the
forefront
,
instead
companies
tend
to
favor
innovation
.
innovation
provides
exciting
and
new
features
to
their
products
that
many
uninformed
or
ignorant
users
are
willing
to
overlook
security
concerns
for
.
this
is
why
many
unknowingly
sacrifice
personal
data
in
exchange
for
personalized
recommendations
,
without
fully
considering
the
implications
of
this
exchange
.
i
believe
because
companies
have
their
interests
overlapping
between
innovation
and
security
,
regulations
ensure
that
average
users
are
protected
.
furthermore
,
due
to
the
nature
of
bureaucracy
,
i
simply
do
not
believe
that
innovation
will
be
hindered
by
regulations
since
regulations
are
so
slowly
created
and
implemented
.
instead
,
i
simply
wish
that
more
regulations
will
be
made
in
tandem
with
new
innovations
,
with
regulation
playing
catch
up
to
new
technologies
rather
than
vice
versa
,
as
the
study
suggests
.
