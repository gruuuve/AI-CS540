the
100-year
project
conceived
by
some
of
the
most
informed
and
foremost
figures
in
artificial
intelligence
gathered
for
its
inaugural
study
panel
in
the
summer
of
2015
deciding
to
comprise
a
report
with
developments
concerning
the
field
.
the
aim
is
to
inform
the
public
on
how
ai
will
redefine
the
urban
landscape
by
2030
with
promises
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
so
long
as
the
proper
policies
are
there
to
facilitate
research
rather
than
hinder
progress
.
the
study
looks
in
detail
at
eight
issues
:
transportation
,
health
care
,
education
,
entertainment
,
low-resource
communities
,
public
safety
,
and
employment
.
most
concerning
is
the
ever-increasing
automation
of
jobs
that
will
invade
every
and
all
employment
sectors
including
``
professional
services
not
historically
performed
by
machines
''
.
the
report
considers
it
unlikely
for
ai
to
advance
so
rapidly
as
to
replace
all
human
jobs
but
concern
lies
in
the
absence
of
social
services
that
offer
a
safety
net
in
the
advent
of
an
inevitable
breakthrough
in
automation
that
will
marginalize
skilled
workers
.
economic
regression
combined
with
an
artificial
intelligence
revolution
if
not
anticipated
will
only
further
tarnish
what
little
trust
the
general
population
has
with
ai
.
the
report
makes
several
attempts
to
either
downplay
this
possibility
by
considering
the
``
sudden
scenario
highly
unlikely
''
by
emphasizing
that
industries
adopt
new
technology
gradually
which
ideally
would
give
way
for
time
to
remedy
solutions
.
the
problem
is
that
breakthroughs
in
the
field
seem
to
come
in
suddenly
where
rapid
adjustment
is
seemingly
impossible
to
institute
and
result
in
rising
tensions
amongst
the
public
,
notably
taxi
drivers
and
their
fight
against
on-demand
transportation
services
that
undermine
their
income
and
livelihood
.
a
sudden
shift
in
skill
demands
will
put
poor
communities
at
risk
more
often
than
not
they
're
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
and
ca
n't
afford
to
go
back
to
school
much
less
pick
up
a
new
trade
,
everyday
not
spent
working
to
earn
a
wage
means
putting
their
families
at
risk
.
without
careful
consideration
the
integration
of
ai
into
the
labor
force
can
have
a
large
negative
impact
on
a
large
portion
of
the
north
american
population
who
already
lack
the
agency
and
a
voice
to
represent
them
.
on
the
other
hand
ai
being
brought
into
the
workforce
can
have
``
the
effect
of
lowering
the
cost
of
many
goods
and
services
''
but
this
may
come
at
a
heavy
cost
or
might
result
in
widening
the
chasm
between
the
lower
and
upper
class
.
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
despite
amazon
being
at
the
forefront
of
implementing
new
ai
technology
from
drones
that
can
deliver
your
packages
to
fully
automated
warehouses
that
all
that
money
is
being
funneled
straight
into
its
ceo
rather
than
increasing
the
wages
of
those
that
operate
in
the
daily
functions
of
the
company
.
these
practices
are
counter
productive
but
commonplace
which
only
taints
the
image
of
ai
and
its
applications
when
it
's
being
used
to
further
elevate
the
upper
class
.
breakthroughs
in
ai
that
increase
efficacy
and
produce
an
increase
in
profits
will
likely
continue
to
accumulate
at
the
top
of
the
corporate
hierarchy
to
the
dismay
of
those
that
helped
push
these
companies
to
where
they
are
today
.
