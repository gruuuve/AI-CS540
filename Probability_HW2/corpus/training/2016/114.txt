100

study

there
is
no
denying
ai
's
ability
to
better
the
world
of
healthcare
in
the
future
as
its
benefits
resonate
in
the
present
.
artificial

has
already
made
great
progresses

and
ai
's
role
in
robotics
has
created
accuracy
in
laparoscopic

unmatched
by
humans
.
despite
its
current
contributions
to
healthcare
,
the
concerns
raised
as
trust
issues
in
stanford
's
100
year
study
on
artificial
intelligence
go
largely
understated
.
stanford
's
100
year
study
puts
faith
in
time
's
ability
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
clinicians
'
trust
in
ai
,
but
this
disparity
proves
insurmountable
as
ai
threatens
the
distribution
of
healthcare
and
the
quality
of
care
in
a
clinical
setting
.
in
a
technologically
saturated
society
,
improper
distribution
of
information
can
cause
negative
backlash
to
consumers
--
especially
in
the
case
of
healthcare
.
a
key
element
of
ai
's
efficacy
is
its
ability
to
access
large
amounts
of
data
to
use
machine
learning
in
the
implementation
of
machine
foresight
.
the
report
states
,
``
hipaa
-lrb-
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
-rrb-
requirements
for
protecting
patient
privacy
create
legal
barriers
to
the
flow
of
patient
data
to
applications
that
could
utilize
ai
technologies
''
(27)
.
however
,
in
easing
this
rule
,
repercussions
can
cause
healthcare
to
become
less
accessible
to
consumers
.
under
current
aca
guidelines
,
an
insurance
company
can
not
deny
membership
to
a
patient
with
preexisting
conditions
,
but
there
is
no
knowing
if
in
100
years
the
aca
will
be
in
effect
.
in
an
unregulated
setting
,
should
software
companies
have
access
to
sensitive
patient
data
,
what
stops
an
insurance
company
from
accessing
the
same
information
?
in
an
extreme
case
,
this
causes
asymmetric
information
in
favor
of
the
insurer
.
say
,
for
instance
,
aggregated
data
has
been
released
to
an
insurance
company
revealing
a
genetic
predisposition
to
cancer
,
hypertension
,
etc.
.
this
could
lead
to
more
discriminatory
membership
practices
or
price
gouging
for
individuals
who
require
access
to
healthcare
the
most
.
when
patients
are
seen
in
an
exam
room
,
ai
has
the
potential
to
compromise
the
quality
of
care
by
widening
the
gap
between
patient
and
doctor
.
the
report
details
possible
ai
implementation
as
``
prime
clinical
decision
support
,
patient
monitoring
and
coaching
''
.
these
applications
imply
less
work
done
by
the
doctor
in
examination
of
a
patient
's
lifestyle
and
health
by
using
software
as
a
middle
man
.
this
gap
is
exacerbated
by
software
's
tendency
to
be
imperfect
in
early
releases
.
with
early
releases
,
predictive
diagnostic
software
may
steer
doctors
away
from
using
gestalt
approaches
to
practicing
care
and
toward
potentially
inaccurate
computer
generated
diagnoses
.
currently
,
ehr
companies
are
in
the
process
of
providing
predictive
diagnostics
through
data
analytics
solutions
.
many
ehr
companies
by
nature
shy
away
from
interoperability
and
adhere
to
strict
standards
of
privacy
leading
to
incomplete
datasets
.
furthermore
,
machine
learning
algorithms
rely
heavily
on
pattern
recognition
.
should
these
two
shortcomings
be
prevalent
in
early
releases
of
diagnostic
software
,
practitioners
will
be
handed
faulty
tools
for
providing
healthcare
.
distrust
in
software
is
only
logical
,
as
computational
resources
are
finite
and
the
software
built
on
that
foundation
would
hardly
be
perfect
.
in
a
perfect
word
,
ai
can
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
a
dynamic
world
of
healthcare
.
however
,
to
err
is
human
,
and
software
built
by
human
hands
is
bound
to
have
its
imperfections
.
the
datasets
ai
software
requires
are
vulnerable
to
improper
usage
resulting
in
wrongful
distribution
of
healthcare
.
furthermore
,
shortcomings
in
data
collection
and
a
culture
of
tech-company
privacy
prove
insurmountable
in
creating
effective
diagnostics
software
.
ai
has
its
place
in
a
hospital
,
but
its
future
lies
in
robotics
and
imaging
,
not
the
exam
room
.
