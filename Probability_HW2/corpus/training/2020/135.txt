one
issue
in
arguing
that
this

a

is
that

likely
failure
to
carefully
eliminate
bias
throughout
the
section
on
public
safety
and
security
,
the
stanford
paper
argues
that
although
ai
has
had
problematic
encounters
with
racial
and
socioeconomic
bias
recently
,
this
bias
should
be
able
to
be
countered
because
ai
is
more
easily
audited
than
humans
.
the
paper
notes
that
this
auditing
will
require
careful
implementation
.
however
,
an
educated
and
thorough
examination
of
ai-powered
tools
is
not
something
that
can
be
assumed
of
governments
.
there
is
a
high
potential
for
governments
to
be
generally
underfunded
,
which
can
leave
ai
as
a
funding
afterthought
.
such
lack
of
ai
funding
has
already
occurred
in
the
united
states
due
to
underfunding
as
well
as
lack
of
policy
,
gaps
in
suitably
educated
management
,
and
difficult
integration
with
previous
low-tech
solutions
-lrb-

-rrb-
.
the
united
states
government
demonstrated
gross
inadequacy
regarding
the
enforcement
of
moral
tech
during
the
trial
of
mark
zuckerberg
-lrb-
7
-rrb-
.
senators
showed
immense
confusion
during
questioning
and
were
unable
to
pinpoint
the
nature
of
the
charges
in
question
,
much
less
determine
with
care
whether
facebook
was
guilty
.
further
,
pressure
is
placed
on
capitalist
governments
to
support
industry
giants
,
which
could
lead
to
foul
play
in
the
trial
.
while
facebook
's
guilt
has
been
widely
agreed
upon
by
third
parties
-lrb-
8
-rrb-
,
zuckerberg
finished
the
trial
without
receiving
major
consequences
for
the
company
.
unless
the
united
states
sees
a
major
rehaul
of
its
tech
sector
with
an
emphasis
on
careful
enforcement
,
there
is
a
high
risk
that
racially
biased
law
enforcement
will
continue
to
reign
unchecked
.
while
ai
behavior
is
indeed
more
easily
tweaked
than
that
of
humans
,
its
tuning
can
just
as
easily
be
severely
neglected
.
during
the
war
on
drugs
-lrb-
9
-rrb-
in
the
reagan
era
,
militant
enforcement
was
seen
as
as
a
righteous
success
by
police
forces
and
the
federal
government
.
only
decades
later
have
top
government
offices
acknowledged
the
bias
and
wrongdoings
of
this
movement
.
in
the
same
vein
,
misleading
reports
of
increased
law
enforcement
could
drive
governments
to
a
prideful
stupor
,
sacrificing
careful
examination
for
bias
and
malpractice
.
much
of
ai
research
regarding
law
enforcement
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
intelligence
agencies
.
because
the
united
states
cia
and
fbi
have
a
dire
history
of
coverups
in
the
midst
of
tremendous
scandals
-lrb-
10
-rrb-
-lrb-
11
-rrb-
it
can
not
be
assured
that
government
agencies
will
not
behave
the
same
way
in
the
event
of
a
racial
bias
crisis
in
tech
.
this
could
become
even
more
plausible
if
agencies
discovered
bias
tech
which
they
could
not
acutely
fix
.
