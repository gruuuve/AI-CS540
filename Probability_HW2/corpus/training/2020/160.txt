challenge
report
the
report
suggests
that
the
stronger
implementation
of
ai
in
education
will
be
extremely
beneficial
at
all
levels
.
they
mention
that
good
teachers
will
always
be
a
part
of
a
good
education
,
but
ai
is
portrayed
as
having
only
a
positive
impact
on
education
.
i
believe
that
in
a
case
like
this
,
it
is
possible
to
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
.
exposing
children
to
such
a
vastly
digital
world
so
early
on
in
their
lives
prevents
them
from
developing
the
valuable
fundamental
skills
that
technology
ca
n't
give
them
.
a
perfect
example
of
something
that
is
not
school
related
but
is
relevant
to
education
would
be
robotic
vacuum
cleaners
.
this
design
is
extremely
convenient
because
you
do
n't
have
to
put
any
effort
into
cleaning
the
house
and
you
can
spend
your
time
doing
something
else
while
the
house
is
being
cleaned
.
however
,
from
a
parental
perspective
,
you
must
think
about
how
this
shapes
a
child
's
mind
.
if
a
kid
does
n't
have
some
form
of
chores
around
the
house
and
observes
that
a
robot
will
take
care
of
it
for
him
,
it
takes
away
crucial
learning
experiences
that
establish
discipline
and
responsibility
at
a
young
age
.
the
same
concept
resonates
in
a
designated
learning
environment
like
schools
.
the
communications
skills
that
are
developed
when
learning
from
teachers
and
discussing
with
fellow
students
are
not
something
that
can
be
fulfilled
by
technology
.
they
also
develop
strong
relationships
with
their
peers
that
help
facilitate
their
learning
.
teaching
robots
and
online
tutoring
can
certainly
be
productive
tools
because
teachers
ca
n't
always
be
there
to
help
all
of
the
time
,
and
when
they
are
there
,
they
can
use
these
tools
to
teach
a
larger
amount
of
kids
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
.
but
these
benefits
are
realized
much
more
in
higher
education
when
a
student
can
take
responsibility
for
their
own
learning
while
they
are
not
in
the
classroom
.
during
earlier
education
,
school
is
about
developing
fundamentals
like
responsibility
,
emotional
balance
,
and
building
relationships
,
among
other
things
,
just
as
much
as
it
is
about
academics
.
the
main
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
let
kids
grow
up
knowing
nothing
but
an
entirely
digitized
life
fueled
by
ai
.
the
key
balance
to
be
aware
of
is
that
while
ai
has
a
developing
presence
in
education
and
many
other
aspects
of
life
,
it
is
important
to
maintain
an
appreciation
for
the
non-digital
life
lessons
that
are
such
a
crucial
part
of
human
development
.
with
that
appreciation
,
you
can
value
the
impact
that
ai
can
have
on
the
world
in
a
much
more
educated
and
experienced
fashion
.
