though
the
article
keeps
convincing
the
readers
that
the
ai
benefits
human
beings
life
in
many
different
ways
,
there
are
one
point
need
further
consideration
on
its
availability
.
i
do
not
deny
the
functionality
and
advantages
made
by
ai
because
there
is
no
fault
to
make
our
lives
much
better
,
but
the
sudden
impulsion
going
into
the
labor
market
is
required
to
be
noticed
and
well-prepared
ahead
of
time
by
both
ai
experts
and
governors
.
to
be
more
detail
,
one
thing
to
challenge
is
the
arrangement
of
the
plan
and
implementation
of
ai
research
.
according
to
article
,
ai
experts
do
not
believe
that
the
machine
will
do
harm
to
human
beings
in
current
days
and
they
will
consider
the
negative
effect
made
by
these
machines
in
the
future

however
,
from
my
perspective
,
the
acceleration
of
ai
industry
will
inevitably
cause
changes
,
or
even
damages
,
to
our
society
in
recent
years
.
with
the
wide
spreading
development
of
ai
,
workers
in
every
field
will
suffer
from
machine
s
challenge
.
since
the
ai
is
designed
to
do
what
human
beings
can
do
by
its
definition
,
some
workers
will
be
substituted
by
the
machine
to
reduce
labor
capital
and
investment
.
in
this
case
,
the
problem
can
be
divided
into
2
sides
,
which
consists
of
both
ai
researchers
and
company
managers
and
governments
.
for
those
ai
researchers
,
the
researching
focus
should
be
shifted
to
extremely
difficult
work
and
projects
instead
of
everyday
work
can
be
easily
done
by
human
beings
,
which
can
help
maintain
workers
working
status
and
working
structure
in
our
society
and
also
support
the
exploration
of
the
unknown
world
.
ai
is
used
to
make
people
s
life
more
convenient
instead
of
changing
our
habits
.
for
example
,
i
think
the
research
in
self-driving
is
redundant
because
we
can
not
make
sure
the
process
is
entirely
safe
.
moreover
,
if
the
self-driving
vehicles
are
invented
,
many
drivers
will
lose
their
jobs
,
which
is
a
great
loss
of
labor
market
.
therefore
,
i
recommend
the
ai
researchers
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
things
that
human
can
not
achieve
like
outer
space
excavation
.
human
body
is
not
adapted
to
this
kind
of
work
in
extreme
environment
.
i
hope
ai
researchers
can
let
ai
explore
the
unknown
world
instead
of
doing
daily
tasks
.
for
company
managers
and
governments
,
it
is
reasonable
to
import
the
usage
of
artificial
intelligence
into
their
work
for
efficiency
.
however
,
if
the
machine
dominates
the
whole
company
,
national
production
and
citizen
s
welfare
will
be
dramatically
reduced
since
they
can
not
work
for
salaries
.
in
this
case
,
i
think
the
governors
should
legislate
for
the
use
of
ai
,
such
as
restrict
the
amount
of
ai
in
an
organization
.
though
ai
is
smart
to
solve
problems
and
help
people
deal
with
work
,
governments
should
let
people
get
opportunities
to
work
and
not
let
ai
occupy
the
whole
industry
.
this
is
consideration
in
humanity
.
overall
,
ai
does
help
with
people
s
lives
,
but
the
usage
needs
some
further
concerns
.
